The ASD had been diagnosed when the patient was 12 years old and TTE had suggested that the right ventricle was dilating. At cardiac catheterisation there were mildly elevated right ventricular systolic pressures and a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of over two. The secundum ASD was estimated to be 15 mm wide using TTE with aneurysmal formation of the interatrial septum. The patient was admitted for percutaneous ASD closure and underwent uncomplicated placement of a 17 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during the procedure revealed the presence of a second ASD near the inferior vena cava and a small post-procedure shunt. The septal occluder did not completely cover both defects. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose (assuming a single posteroanterior projection chest x-ray is eight centi-Gray/cm2) was 400. Repeat TTE continued to demonstrate left to right shunting and the patient was readmitted for a further device closure six months later. At cardiac catheterisation, the second defect was identified low in the secundum septum between the fossa ovalis and the mouth of the coronary sinus. The defect was successfully closed with a 9 mm Amplatzer septal occluder with no evidence of obstructed flow in either the coronary sinus or the inferior vena cava. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the second procedure was 187. The patient remained well with no evidence of residual shunt six months following the procedure.","[[34.0, 'year']]",F,2004,heart

The defect was estimated to be 10 mm wide on TTE with evidence of right atrial and right ventricular dilatation. Left atrial size was normal. She was referred was further investigation and treatment. Cardiac catheterisation demonstrated a pulmonary to systemic flow shunt of four to one. Peri-procedure TEE revealed that there were two defects; one measuring 24 mm located inferiorly between the inferior vena cava and coronary sinus os with the second defect situated superiorly and measuring 30 mm. The inferior defect was closed using a 24 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose was 403. The patient was discharged the following day and readmitted three months later for closure of the superior defect. This was performed using a 30 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. The procedure was technical difficult as after deployment of the left sided disc, the device initially lay obliquely in the defect. The final position was satisfactory with no evidence of intra-cardiac shunting (figure ). There was no interference between the two devices and mitral valve function remained normal. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the second procedure was 727. The patient remained well and at six month follow-up there was no evidence of residual shunt.","[[31.0, 'year']]",F,2004,heart

TEE suggested that the atrial septum was fenestrated with a small inferior rim of tissue and she was referred for device closure. At cardiac catheterisation it became clear that there were two principal defects, one in the fossa ovalis and the other situated inferior and posterior between the fossa ovalis and the coronary sinus. The superior hole was closed with a 16 mm Amplatzer septal occluder but failed to cover the inferior defect. A 15 mm Amplatzer septal occluder device was subsequently placed successfully across the inferior defect with a stable position (figure ). Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the procedure was 124. Subsequent follow-up revealed a small left to right shunt between the two septal occluders but further intervention was not considered necessary.","[[30.0, 'year']]",F,2004,heart

He had a past medical history of cerebral palsy and spastic quadriparesis. Three years ago, he had an ITB pump implanted for spasticity refractory to the high doses of oral baclofen. He had a significant improvement in spasticity, social and functional capacity in the past three years.
Later, he developed some disorientation and increased spasticity. He was taken to a local physician who prescribed oral baclofen (120 mg daily in four divided doses) for his increased spasticity. He also advised him to have his ITB pump checked immediately. The following day, his spasticity increased even after taking oral baclofen. He developed multiple seizures and respiratory distress in the next 24-hour period. Subsequently, he was admitted in a local hospital where he was orally intubated and transferred to our ICU for aggressive management.
On presentation, his temperature was 104.6¶øF (40.3¶øC), heart rate 127 beats per minute, and the blood pressure was 85/45 mm/Hg. His ventilator settings were: assist-control ventilation mode; respiratory rate, 15 breaths per minute; tidal volume, 650 mL; positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), 5 cm H2O; and FiO2, 60%. His spontaneous respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100% was noted on pulse oximetry. In the local hospital, he was documented to have a high fever of 107¶øF (41.6¶øC) and he had received intravenous lorazepam, phenytoin, pantoprazole, piperacillin/tazobactem and dopamine. On physical examination, neurologically he was unconscious with decerebrate posturing and his Glasgow coma scale was 6. He had an absent corneal and gag reflexes. He was moving all four limbs in response to noxious stimuli. He was also noted to have an extreme spasticity in all four limbs. Lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the left lower base. Cardiac examination was unremarkable. He had a palpable baclofen pump on abdominal wall and bowel sounds were heard. The differential diagnoses were septic shock, meningitis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and malignant hyperthermia.
The initial laboratory results showed serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) 5250 U/L (Normal, 25ƒ??235 U/L) and CPK-MB fraction 12.1 ng/ml (Normal, 0.5ƒ??6.3 U/L). Serum chemistry revealed sodium 142 mmol/L, potassium 5.1 mmol/L, chloride 120 mmol/L, bicarbonate 13 mmol/L, and creatinine 2.1 mg/dl. Hemogram showed white blood cell count 12.2 K/UL, hemoglobin 16.5 g/dl and platelet count 9 K/UL (Normal, 130ƒ??400 K/UL). Liver function test showed aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) 1128 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (AST) 1140 U/L, alkaline phophatase 90 U/L, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dl, conjugated bilirubin 0.7 mg/dl, prothrombin time 20.2 seconds (Normal, 10ƒ??12.5 seconds), and INR 2.0 (Normal, 0.9ƒ??1.1). Blood and urine cultures were obtained. Chest radiograph was normal. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed atelectasis of the left lung base. His CT scan of head did not show any acute infarct or bleeding. His initial management included intravenous fluids, norepinephrine, platelet transfusion, phenytoin, propofol and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone) for suspected meningitis and septic shock. He received intravenous lorazepam (4ƒ??8 mg every four hours) for his spasticity. Next day, his spasticity improved and an ITB specialist investigated his baclofen pump. His baclofen pump analysis revealed that it was stopped due to some programming error, which was restarted at a previously prescribed baclofen rate (260 ×¬g/day).
On third hospital day, his serum CPK was 15,878 U/L, AST was 2566 U/L, ALT was 2993 U/L, while CPK-MB fraction came down to 3.4 ng/ml. His urine output decreased (<400 ml/ day) and serum creatinine increased in the range of 5ƒ??6 mg/dl. Later, he was hemodialyzed few times during the course of hospitalization due to acute renal failure. His echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 20ƒ??25% and severe global hypokinesis. His electroencephalogram did not reveal any epileptogenic activity. He developed full-blown multisystem organ failure with an evidence of shock liver, renal failure, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation and myocardial depression. His nutrition was started on nasogastric tube feedings, and proper ventilator care was taken through a tracheostomy tube. His serum baclofen obtained at the time of admission was less than 0.02 ×¬g/ml (Expected values, 0.08ƒ??0.4 ×¬g/ml). After a three-week course of aggressive management in ICU, he was weaned off from the ventilator and his multiple organ shock resolved. At a six-month follow-up, he was observed in a nursing home with his baseline functional, social, and family activities.","[[24.0, 'year']]",M,2004,heart
11,514718-1,15310408,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC514718.xml,Atypical vessels as an early sign of intracardiac myxoma?,"A 62-year-old woman with known metabolic syndrome was referred to our clinic to exclude coronary artery disease invasively. She has been experiencing chest pain for four months which has not increased in frequency or duration since it started. She denied pain at rest, nocturnal pain, difficulty breathing, or palpitations. An echocardiographic stress examination revealed significant ischemia with anteroseptal hypokinesia. Cardiac chambers were morphologically normal. The ""baseline"" echocardiography and stress echo was unsuspicious of a left atrial myxoma (Fig. ).
Coronary angiography revealed coronary artery disease with a stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) near the left main stem. A stent was implanted in the proximal LAD with no residual stenosis. The ventricle was morphologically normal.
A coronary angiography performed 13 months after stent implantation showed no re-stenosis and a normal left ventricle. No echocardiogram was performed at this time 32 months after the control coronary angiography, the patient was readmitted because of increasing dyspnoea and palpitations. A transthoracic echocardiography disclosed a big (70 Ç? 30 mm) mass in the left atrium attached to the interatrial septum. The tumor prolapsed into the left ventricle obstructing the mitral valve orifice (Fig ). The mean pressure gradient across the mitral valve was 8 mm Hg.
A subsequent coronary angiography and LV and RV catheterization detected a mean diastolic pressure gradient of 12 mm Hg between the pulmonary capillary wedge and the left ventricular enddiastolic pressure, and no re-stenosis of the LAD stent. The angiography was notable for a large area with small atypical, tortuous vessels in the region of the interatrial septum. These vessels were shown to originate from branches of the right coronary artery (RCA) and the circumflex coronary artery (RCX). (Fig. )
Surgery was promptly performed and the tumor was successfully excised. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of a cardiac myxoma.
A retrospective analysis of the initial coronary angiographies (baseline, 13 and 45 months) disclosed the atypical vessels in a small area of interatrial septum (Fig. , , ).","[[62.0, 'year']]",F,2004,heart

The patient had noted a sudden increase in the size of the lump over the preceding two months. He did not report any neck pressure symptoms, weight loss or anorexia. His past history included right partial thyroidectomy for a solitary nodule (colloid goitre) in 1978 and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm in 1994. He had suffered myocardial infarction in 1995 and had an episode of acute coronary insufficiency in January 2003. His recent coronary angiograms showed an occluded left anterior descending artery and echocardiogram revealed good left ventricular function. He was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol in moderation. He had been taking warfarin, diltiazem MR, lisinopril, uniphyllin, glyceryl trinitrate tablets and buccal suscard.
On examination he had left sided goitre extending superiorly into the posterior triangle and inferiorly into the retrosternal space, with variable consistency. The trachea was deviated to the right and there was cervical lymphadenopathy on the left side. Systemic examination was unremarkable and fine needle aspiration of thyroid gland showed presence of HÇ¬rthle cells. Computerised tomographic (CT) scan with contrast enhancement (figure &) of the neck and thorax revealed large left sided thyroid goitre with significant mediastinal extension. It showed mixed attenuation with foci of calcification peripherally. There was a 3 cm complex mass on the left side of the neck, posterior to the carotid sheath structures and deep to the sternomastoid, indicative of lymph node metastases. Thyroid profile and routine blood investigations were unremarkable.
Based on the above findings radical surgery was planned. On exploration of the neck we confirmed left goitre with intrathoracic extension and enlarged lymph nodes under the sternocleidomastoid close to the jugulodigastric muscle and surrounding the carotid sheath. There was no remnant thyroid tissue seen on the right side following the previous thyroid surgery. Left hemithyroidectomy with modified neck dissection (lymphadenectomy, preserving all vessels and nerves) was performed. Macroscopic examination of the thyroid lobe showed a well defined solid pale brown mass approximately 8 cm in maximum dimension, surrounded by a narrow rim of preserved thyroid tissue. The lymph node specimen comprised of several nodules of partly necrotic tissue. Microscopic examination showed the thyroid lobe containing a HÇ¬rthle cell neoplasm, which was mostly encapsulated, with foci of capsular and vascular invasion. The two lymph nodes revealed metastatic HÇ¬rthle cell carcinoma. [pT3, N1a, Mx], (Figure &).
The patient had adjuvant therapy with oral radioiodine 131 (3060 MBq Sodium Iodine). He was put on a daily dose of 100 mcg of thyroxine. This was to be followed by a second dose of 5911 MBq of radioactive iodine six months from the time of the first dose.","[[79.0, 'year']]",M,2004,heart
13,515303-1,15318947,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC515303.xml,Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome: Brain death following hemodialysis for metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure ƒ?? A case report,"A 22-year-old homosexual male presented to hospital with progressive dyspnea, productive cough, generalized malaise and fever. He had a known history of intravenous cocaine abuse and recent serology in prior 3 months was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Results of a physical examination showed signs of tachypnea, tachycardia, accessory muscle use and left lung base crackles. Tympanic temperature was 34.7¶øC. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable except for urethral meatus stenosis.
Initial laboratory investigations are presented in Table . Arterial blood gases showed pH of 6.95, PaCO2 10 mmHg, PaO2 109 mmHg, HCO3 2 mmol/L, and lactate 0.6 mmol/L consistent with high anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 587 ×¬mol/L and 46.7 mmol/L, respectively. Toxicology and drug screen was negative. The metabolic acidosis was partially accounted for by acute renal failure with retained unmeasured anions and ketonemia. Urinalysis showed pyuria. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm.
Chest radiograph revealed right middle lobe and lingular patchy opacification. An abdomino-pelvic CT scan demonstrated moderate to severe bilateral hydronephrosis, bladder wall thickening with multiple diverticuli, and retroperitoneal streaking consistent with acute infection. A provisional diagnosis of severe sepsis was made with multiple potential foci of infection. The patient was given empiric ceftriaxone, metronidazole and vancomycin. Sputum specimen cultured heavy methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, blood cultures were positive for S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Group B Streptococcus. Urine cultured greater than 108 CFU/L of multiple gram positive and negative organisms.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The metabolic acidosis persisted (pH 7.00) a despite 100 mEq of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate bolus and infusion of three liters of normal bicarbonate solution (150 mEq of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate in 1000 mL D5W). The patient had a suprapubic bladder catheter inserted by angiography. However, due to concern the patient remained oliguric following 4 L crystalloid resuscitation, hemodialysis was organized. Hemodialysis parameters included: F160 membrane (surface area 1.5 m2 and KUf 50 mL/hr/mmHg), dialysate sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 3 mmol/L, calcium 1.25 mmol/L, bicarbonate 40 mmol/L, and QD 500 mL/min, QB 250ƒ??300 mL/min via a 25 cm left femoral double-lumen Uldall catheter. The patient had 71.5 L of blood processed over four hours with no fluid removal. Although the patient was alert and appropriate (Glasgow Coma Scale 15) with tachycardia and stable normal range blood pressure before the initiation of dialysis, he was demonstrating an increased work of breathing and oxygen requirements suggestive of worsening sepsis syndrome. Approximately 2.5 hrs after start of dialysis the patient became rapidly unresponsive prompting intubation for airway protection. At completion of HD and over the subsequent 4 hours the patient's neurologic status deteriorated with evidence of loss of all brainstem reflexes. Head CT-scan is shown in Figure .
Repeat laboratory investigations immediately following hemodialysis revealed a pH 7.36, HCO3 19 mmol/L, sodium 132 mmol/L, potassium 1.8 mmol/L, and urea 13.7 mmol/L (urea-reduction-ratio was 71%) (Table ).
The patient rapidly progressed to refractory shock and multi-organ dysfunction Diagnosis of brain death was declared independently by an intensivist and a neurologist. At autopsy, the brain showed evidence of diffuse cerebral edema. Cardiac assessment showed left ventricular enlargement consistent with systemic hypertension likely as a result of chronic kidney disease. Both lungs showed patchy acute bronchopneumonia with edema and congestion. Both kidneys appeared grossly pyonephrotic with dilated, thickened ureters and suggested the presence of acute on chronic pyelonephritis. The meatal aperture was scarred and stenosed.","[[22.0, 'year']]",M,2004,heart

The patient did not have a history of abnormal calcium metabolism, or hyperparathyroidism. Upon listing his serum ionized calcium was 1.07 mmol/L. The donor was a previously healthy, 42-year-old male, who suffered intracranial bleeding following a motor vehicle crash. He did not suffer any period of hypoxia but he was hypotensive (SBP = 90 mm Hg) prior to procurement. His serum liver function tests were normal prior to harvesting (AST 32 U/L, ALT 40 U/L). The organ was procured by our institution's transplant team. During procurement the liver was found to be well perfused with no focal injuries and no macroscopic evidence of steatosis.
The recipient underwent an uncomplicated conventional LT without the use of a veno-venous bypass. There were no periods of hypoxia or severe hypotension during transplantation. The cold ischemic time of the graft was 8 hours while the warm ischemic time was 45 minutes. The graft reperfused well and no biopsies were taken. Intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg) was administered intraoperatively, and postoperatively the patient received induction with Antithymocyte Globulin, which is the protocol followed at our institution. During transplantation the patient received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
At the time of LT, the international normalization ratio (INR) was 1.53, while serum total bilirubin was 103 ×¬mol/L (Figure ). On postoperative day 2 the patient had a peak of his serum AST (3469 U/L) and at this point he had further biochemical evidence of primary graft dysfunction, with inability to normalize his INR (Figure ), and with progressive elevation of his total serum bilirubin (Figure ). Repeated ultrasonographic examination revealed a patent hepatic artery and portal vein, as well as patent hepatic veins. At this point, a liver biopsy demonstrated severe reperfusion injury with several apoptotic bodies, several dystrophic calcifications (Figure ), and no evidence of acute cellular rejection. His clinical status deteriorated, he developed multiorgan system failure and died 12 days after his transplantation. No septic focus was identified. Both kidneys harvested from the same donor did not present any signs of delayed graft function after transplantation.","[[65.0, 'year']]",M,2004,heart

The patient had a medical history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) diagnosed at the age of 18, refractory to steroid-based treatment. A splenectomy was performed, and she remained with normal platelet counts. She was diagnosed at 60 years-old with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), and received treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-Imatinib. The diagnosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH), in which 22% were negative cells and 78% positive cells for the Philadelphia chromosome. The qPCR for BCR-ABL/ABL was 40.22% (15,420.24 ABL copies, and 6202.4 BCR-ABL copies). On admission, she admitted to voluntarily had stopped the Imatinib treatment 6 months before due to a major depression, had fever and worsening eyesight (later diagnosed as acute uveitis) (Fig. ). She had no history of travelling to leptospirosis endemic areas, nor alcohol, drug or tobacco abuse, neither other medications intake. Nevertheless, she had close contact with her pet cat. She was admitted to the hospital with acute respiratory failure, bacteraemia and uveitis.
Laboratory tests showed leukocyte count of 144.6 Ç? 103/ml, hemoglobin 12.4 g/dl, platelets 763 Ç? 103/ml, glucose level of 116 mg/dl, and albumin level of 3.0 mg/dl. Liver function test showed malnourishment and low protein level. Renal function test showed high creatinine level indicating an acute kidney injury mainly associated with the inflammatory response, and electrolytes were within normal limits. Additionally, the levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were moderately high (Supplementary Table ). Due to respiratory deterioration, a sputum culture was performed, and E. coli was isolated. In MÇ¸xico, at the time the patient was treated, there was an outbreak of influenza, reason why a diagnostic qPCR for the influenza virus was performed; the result was negative. The chest X-Ray revealed multiple pneumonia foci (Fig. ). She was started on empirical broad antibiotic regimen. Blood and urine cultures collected on admission showed no microorganisms grown from conventional medium or seen on Gram, Ziehl-Nielsen, and Giemsa stains. The blood cultures in the BacT/ALERT¶© FA medium (bioMÇ¸rieux, Durham NC), after 2 days of incubation at 34 ¶øC, were positive. Unstained spirochaete-like microorganisms were observed by dark-field microscopy. Due to clinical and microbiological finding, the antimicrobial treatment was changed to penicillin 20 million UI/ IV, plus doxycycline 100 mg twice a day. Subsequently, two blood samples were tested by Microagglutination test (MAT) separated from each other by 10 days (Supplementary Methodology Document). Differential diagnosis were performed, and negative results were reported. After the successful treatment, the CML treatment was resumed with a second-generation TKI (Dasatinib). A year later, the FISH analysis showed 35 negative cells and 65 positive cells for the Philadelphia chromosome. The aspiration of bone marrow showed an adequate maturation, compatible with CML in chronic phase.
Microagglutination test (MAT) was performed as previously described by the Pan American Health Organization []. The patientƒ??s sera were diluted to 1/50 for a screening test and 50 ×¬l of live cultures of 4 to 7 days in EMJH medium of twelve L. interrogans serovars were used as antigens (Autumnalis, Bataviae, Bratislava, Canicola, Celledoni, Grippotyphosa, Hardjoprajitno, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona, Pyrogenes, Tarassovi, Wolffi and Mini) (Supplementary Table ). Each serovar was added into a column of a 96-well flat end microtitre plate (Nunc, Maryland, USA); a negative control was included for each serovar. The plate was gently stirred and incubated 1 hour at room temperature. Reading was performed in dark-field microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The patientƒ??s sera were serially diluted from 1/25 to 1/1600, and the microagglutination was observed for each serovar. The final titre represents the maximum dilution in which the agglutination grade two was noted.
From the patientƒ??s blood sample, three drops were seeded into EMJH liquid medium and maintained at 30 ¶øC. Cultures were periodically observed in dark-field microscopy to spot spirochaetal forms and maintained for 6 months before being considered negative cultures. In parallel, the patientƒ??s blood sample was inoculated to a Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) for bacterial isolation [] (Supplementary Methodology Document and Supplementary Table ).
DNA was extracted from the patientƒ??s blood samples and the hamsterƒ??s tissues with the DNeasy Blood &Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Cal, USA), according to the manufacturerƒ??s instructions and suspended in 50 ×¬L of nuclease-free water. DNA was quantified using an Epoch microplate spectrophotometer (Biotech) and stored at 4 ¶øC.
The Leptospira genus-specific PCR based on the 23S rDNA was used to amplify a 482 bp fragment []. A second PCR was performed to identify only pathogenic strains based on the amplification of the insertion sequence IS1500 of L. interrogans (sensu lato) [] (Supplementary Methodology Document). The electrophoresis of the amplified products were stained with ethidium bromide on 1.6% agarose gels and visualised. Further genus identification was performed based on sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, using the primers 27f (5ƒ?ý-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3ƒ?ý) and 1492r (5ƒ?ý-TACGCYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3ƒ?ý) with DNA extracted from the first blood sample as template []. A PCR product of 1432 bp was amplified, purified, and DNA was sequenced in both directions. Nucleotide sequence was determined with Taq FS Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Fluorescence-Based Sequencing, and analysed on an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA sequencing system (Foster City, CA, USA). The sequence was registered in Genbank under the accession number MN545905. It has 100% homology with Leptospira interrogans strains (CP011410.1, AE016823.1, AE010300.2, and CP018146.1) and variable homology with reference sequences (Supplementary Methodology Document and Supplementary Table ).
In summary, the results support the diagnosis of leptospirosis; abundant spirochaetal forms, at least 106
Leptospires/mL were observed in dark field microscopy, The MAT results (Supplementary Table ) indicated the serovar Bratislava as the most probable causing serovar because the patientƒ??s serum reacted with Bratislava (Jez Bratislava) in titres of 1/320. This titre was the highest in the first sample and stayed in a steady-state in the second sample. There was no other serovar with titres at this level. Titres to Serovars Bataviae (Van Tienen); Canicola (Hond Utech IV); Grippotyphosa (Moska V); Hardjo (Hardjoprajitno), and Pomona (Pomona) were lower than 1/80 in both samples, and those for Pyrogenes (Salinem) fell from 1/160 to 1/80 in the second sample. During the Leptospira isolation attempt, its survival was sustained for about a month in the EMJH medium, but it did not flourish. The PCRs based on the23S rDNA and the IS1500 identified the presence of the bacteria DNA in the patientƒ??s blood samples, in the hamster tissues (Supplementary Table ), and the Leptospira genus was identified by the 16S based sequencing.","[[65.0, 'year']]",F,2/28/2020,liver

Earlier, at 25 weeks of gestation, the patient reported vaginal spotting. An ultrasound performed by her primary obstetrician was suggestive of a placenta percreta. At 30 weeks, she experienced a preterm premature rupture of membranes and moderate vaginal bleeding requiring her admission in a primary care hospital. During her stay, she received tocolytics, antibiotics and steroids. Strict bed rest was prescribed but no thrombosis prophylaxis was administered given her history of vaginal bleeding that lasted one week. Upon confirming the diagnosis of placenta previa with accreta spectrum on a pelvic MRI, the patient was referred to our tertiary care center to schedule her delivery.
Eight months earlier, she underwent a cesarean section due to a protracted labor. Postoperatively, she received no prophylactic anticoagulation. Besides, she was taking oral contraceptives for three months because of a persistent vaginal bleeding; she stopped them three months before pregnancy. The patient reported no relevant past medical or surgical events. Her father died at the age of 42 of an ischemic stroke and two uncles had histories of non-specific thromboembolic events.
On admission, the patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable and did not complain of pelvic pain. She noted only light to moderate persistent vaginal bleeding. Urgent ultrasound showed a viable fetus with appropriate biometrical parameters and no amniotic fluid. Fetal cardiotocography revealed regular uterine contractions. She underwent urgent delivery by cesarean section and hysterectomy under general anesthesia according to our specially developed technique [, ]. The placenta was previa, anteriorly located and slightly lateralized to the left and reached the uterine serosa without perforating it. The placenta was bulging under a thin uterine serosa with a lot of neo-vascularization at this level.
The total estimated blood loss during surgery was 1800 ml. This large amount of intraoperative bleeding was essentially from the vagina, which was unfortunately uncontrollable before removing the uterus completely. The anesthesiologist in charge had to transfuse the patient with allogenic red blood cells (RBC; 7 units), fresh-frozen plasma (FFP; 6 units) and platelets (1 unit) to maintain her hemodynamic stability. Since more than four RBC units were transfused in less than one hour, the transfusion was considered massive and 1:1 ratio of FFP to RBC scheme was used. At the end of surgery and transfusion, an evaluation of complete blood count (CBC) revealed a hematocrit level of 32% and hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dl. The patient was also normothermic and hemodynamically stable. She was waked up from anesthesia and was transferred to ICU for postoperative surveillance. At ICU admission, she was hemodynamically stable with normal neurologic examination.
Two hours later, the patient became cyanotic and went into cardio pulmonary arrest. Cardiac monitoring showed pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Arterial blood gases showed hypocapnia (PaCO2 of 30 mmHg) and hypoxia (PaO2 of 61 mmHg). Characteristic S1Q3 wave detected on electrocardiography was associated with hypoxia and hypocania, which were highly suggestive of pulmonary embolism (PE). She was intubated and received 40 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A transthoracic echocardiogram done in ICU showed a thrombus in the right ventricle. Urgent pulmonary angiogram after hemodynamic stabilization confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral massive PE (Fig. ).
So the patient underwent an urgent thoracotomy and an extracorporeal circulation was used. During surgery, a simultaneous transesophageal cardiac ultrasound was done showing a dilated right ventricle containing clots. A pulmonary artery thrombectomy was performed and multiple clots were retrieved from the pulmonary artery (Fig. ).
Once the situation was stabilized, an inferior vena cava filter was placed via an abdominal incision and external iliac vein catheterization. After weaning from extracorporeal circulation, an intraoperative transesophageal cardiac ultrasound revealed the presence of a new free-floating thrombus in the right atrium and right ventricle (). A second extracorporeal circulation using new cannulation of the large vessels was initiated and a second embolectomy was performed. The patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery care unit (CSU) for surveillance. While at CSU, she was placed on therapeutic intravenous heparin for anticoagulation and had compressive pneumatic stockings in place at all times.
Two days later, the patient experienced a major hemoperitoneum with distended abdomen and tachycardia due to massive anticoagulation that necessitated a second laparotomy to achieve hemostasis. Only blood clots were found in the peritoneal cavity without active source of bleeding. All vascular pedicles were controlled and the vaginal cuff was re-sutured. Intraoperative evaluation of CBC revealed a hematocrit level of 26% and hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dl. Intraoperative allogeneic RBC (4 units) and FFP (5 units) were transfused. The rest of her post-operative course was uneventful.
The patient was discharged on postoperative day 13. She received acenocoumarol per os for a lifetime anticoagulation. A follow-up was organized with a hematologist to perform a full thromboembolic disease work-up. A panel of tests for hypercoagulability was performed and showed: protein S deficiency, presence of circulating lupus anticoagulant, heterozygous methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutation and genotypes of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), human platelet antigen (HPA), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and apolipiprotein E (Apo E) with a moderate risk for thrombosis.
The pathologic report confirmed the diagnosis of abnormally invasive placenta type percreta (grade 3a, according to FIGO classification): hysterectomy specimen showing villous tissue reaching the uterine serosa and in multiple places breaching the serosa and invading the extrauterine adipose tissue with a fibrous reaction at this level.","[[22.0, 'year']]",F,2/28/2020,liver

Pain was described as sharp in nature, intermittent, worsened by eating, and without any relieving factors. It was associated with nausea and had been progressively increasing in intensity and frequency of occurrence. She was diagnosed with type 1 DM 11 years prior, which was poorly controlled, with a mean HbA1c of 12.05% over a 2-year period. She had been admitted multiple times for DKA.
At presentation, the patient appeared well developed for her age except for a short stature and being underweight (BMI 17.54). She was tachycardic (HR 117 bpm) and tender in the right upper and lower quadrants of the abdomen without guarding or rebound tenderness. The liver was palpable 3 inches below the right costal margin. Laboratory results revealed mild DKA as evidenced by the elevated blood sugar (344 mg/dl), anion gap acidosis of 17, HCO3 of 18 mMol/L, venous pH 7.31, serum ketones < 1 : 4 dilution, and trace urine ketones. Her blood glucose reduced to 76 mg/dl after two liters of intravenous fluids. Her home insulin regimen was promptly resumed, and she did not require an insulin infusion. AST (511 mg/dl), ALT (366 mg/dl), and ALP (304 mg/dl) were elevated. Lactic acid was elevated at 8.0 mg/dL. Total bilirubin (0.4 mg/dl), albumin (4 mg/dl), INR (0.9), and platelet count (248 cells/microliter) were within normal limits. HbA1c on presentation was 11.5%. Other laboratory values including amylase and lipase were within normal limits.
Commuted tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast (Figures and ) showed an enlarged liver, 26 cm in full length with mass effect on adjacent structures including the inferior vena cava, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and hepatic flexure of the colon. Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler was negative for hepatic vein thrombosis. Of note, the patient was not on any hepatotoxic medications. Laboratory workup for causes of elevated liver enzymes including: infective workup (EBV, CMV, Hepatitis A, B, and C), iron studies (normal ferritin, decreased total iron, and iron saturation), ceruloplasmin level, serum alpha-fetoprotein, and thyroid function were all within normal limits. Celiac disease had been ruled out previously in the outpatient setting with negative tissue transglutaminase antibodies and endomysial antibody. Autoimmune workup including antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer, antismooth muscle antibody, antimitochondrial antibody, and liver/kidney microsome were all negative or within normal limits. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal right and left ventricular functions, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55ƒ??60%.
CT-guided biopsy of the liver was done due to diagnostic uncertainty and increasing AST/ALT (). Liver biopsy showed pale and swollen hepatocytes () with heavy glycogen staining seen on Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) stain () which was absent after digestion with diastases (). Numerous intranuclear glycogen inclusions, as well as some patchy steatosis, were noted. There were no signs of fibrosis or increased iron deposition.
A diagnosis of glycogenic hepatopathy was made. She was managed symptomatically for pain and strict glycemic control was implemented. Symptoms of abdominal pain improved, and lactic acid returned to normal (1.7 mg/dl) on hospital day 3 with adequate fluid resuscitation. The patient was discharged home on hospital day 7 () with a more aggressive insulin regimen, and follow-ups with her primary care physician (PCP) and endocrinologist were scheduled. At discharge (day 7), AST, ALT, and ALP were 237 mg/dl, 271 mg/dl, and 200 mg/dl, respectively. Unfortunately, the patient was not compliant with follow-up and was not seen for another year at which time her HbA1C was 12.6%. Liver enzymes however were within normal limits with ALT, AST, and ALP at 20 mg/dl, 35 mg/dl, and 54 mg/dl, respectively. Repeat contrasted CT abdomen twelve months later showed persistent hepatomegaly measuring 27.8 Ç? 21.4 Ç? 15.5 cm (Figures and ). Liver dimensions were similar to the CT findings at initial presentation. The importance of strict glycemic control was reemphasized, and she was rescheduled for follow-up with her primary care physician and endocrinologist.","[[23.0, 'year']]",F,2020,liver

Before ocular symptoms, he had got a mild cold and cough for several days. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with HSP, manifesting symptoms of hematuria and purpura. His clinical manifestations were resolved with the treatment of intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone. He had only once recurrence of symptoms after an attack of influenza during the 2 years.
Five weeks ago, he experienced blurred vision in both eyes, especially in the left eye but he didnƒ??t pay much attention. At that time, he was taking 2.5 mg oral prednisolone per day and he ceased prednisolone 1 week later. At present, the patient had no symptoms of active HSP symptoms and had normal blood pressure. He denied a history of hypertension and trauma. There were no abnormal findings upon the total blood cell count, coagulation profile, and the function of the liver and kidney.
On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/12 on the right eye and 6/48 on the left, with a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. The anterior chamber was quiet. Fundus examination and retinal fluorescein angiography(FA) revealed diffuse, tortuous, and dilated retinal vein with scattered round-like retinal hemorrhages (Fig. a-c). The optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed cystoid macular edema (ME) in both eyes (Fig. d).
The patient began to take intravenous dexamethasone 10 mg per day and experienced a significant improvement on the following day. Seven days later, his BCVA was 6/6 on the right eye and 6/12 on the left with a significant reduction in macular edema, which was demonstrated by the OCT images (Fig. a).
Unfortunately, ME of the left eye reoccurred 1 week after he switched to oral prednisoneME (Fig. b), and the vision decreased to 6/60 again on the left eye and remained 6/6 on the right eye. He received 3 + PRN of intravitreal aflibercept injection in both eyes, with three injections in the right eye and four injections in the left eye. His VA improved to 6/6 on the right eye and 6/7.5 on the left with the regression of retinal hemorrhages (Fig. a) and then faded awayfrom macular edema (Fig. b) after 6 months follow-up (Fig. ).","[[21.0, 'year']]",M,2/28/2020,liver

On admission, she was disoriented with a Glasgow coma scale of 10 (E4V2M4), and her vital signs were BP 69/40 mmHg, PR 60 beats/min, and oxygen saturation 79% with oxygen therapy via a nonrebreather face mask at 10 L/min. Physical examination revealed pupil miosis, excess salivation, urinary incontinence, and watery diarrhea, but no obvious signs of dehydration. A blood gas analysis suggested acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (arterial carbon dioxide, 51.8 mmHg; arterial oxygen tension, 41.5 mmHg). Laboratory data showed mild leukocytosis and serum cholinesterase (ChE) of 8 IU/L. Other blood tests, including kidney function, liver function including serum albumin, C-reactive protein, and blood glucose, were within normal ranges. Her head computed tomography (CT) scan, electrocardiography, and chest X-ray were unremarkable. Her chest CT scan revealed slight centrilobular nodules with a large amount of intrabronchial secretion. She was diagnosed with distigmine-induced cholinergic crisis followed by acute hypercapnic respiratory failure because of alveolar hypoventilation due to bronchorrhea.
After admission, distigmine was discontinued, and she received supplemental oxygen therapy and ceftriaxone treatment for a possible concurrent pneumonia. Altered mental status, pupil miosis, respiratory failure, excess salivation, urinary incontinence, and watery diarrhea were gradually resolved in 5 days with a concomitant increase of serum ChE (Table (A)).","[[77.0, 'year']]",F,2/29/2020,liver

She was referred to our department for further evaluation. On admission to our hospital, physical examination revealed pupil miosis but no findings of lacrimation, urination, or bronchorrhea. The emergency physician noticed 9 rivastigmine patches (4 patches of a 9-mg/day formula and 5 of a 13.5-mg/day formula) attached to her both knees. She said that she mistakenly used these patches instead of topical analgesia. Laboratory data showed mild leukocytosis and a serum ChE of 22 IU/L. Other blood tests, including kidney function, liver function, C-reactive protein, and blood glucose, were within normal ranges. Her head CT scan, electrocardiography, and chest X-ray were unremarkable. She was suspected to be in cholinergic crisis caused by rivastigmine overdose and was admitted for close observation without rivastigmine use. The day after her admission, her symptoms, headache, lightheadedness, and miosis were almost resolved with a concomitant increase of serum ChE (Table (B)).

Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, bilateral wheezing in both lung fields, and no hepatosplenomegaly or stigmata of chronic liver disease. Serial cardiac enzymes and electrocardiograms were within normal limits. Chest roentgenogram revealed no pulmonic consolidation or infiltrates. Laboratory analysis revealed leukocytosis, normal hemoglobin and platelet counts, and normal blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Liver function tests were initially normal, except for an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 72 U/L (, column 2). He was diagnosed with asthma exacerbation secondary to upper respiratory tract infection and treated with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily orally for 7 days; intravenous corticosteroids, which were subsequently converted to a tapering dose of oral prednisone; and resumption of home medications. He was discharged on hospital day 6 when his symptoms subsided after completing 3 days of clarithromycin therapy.
Ten days after discharge and 6 days after completing a seven-day course of clarithromycin, the patient represented with diffuse abdominal pain for 4 days. Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 147/92 mmHg; otherwise normal vital signs; a soft, distended, diffusely tender abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds and no rebound tenderness or guarding; and no stigmata of chronic liver disease. There was mild leukocytosis and normal hemoglobin level, while the aminotransferase levels were significantly elevated, and international normalized ratio (INR) was 0.9 (, column 3). The lactic acid was 0.6 mmol/L (normal: 0.5ƒ??2.2 mmol/L), ammonia was 22 ¶æmol/L (normal 11ƒ??35 ¶æmol/L), and acetaminophen level was <4.0 ¶æg/ml. The next day vital signs were stable, with no change in abdominal exam. The AST and ALT levels rose to >1,000 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase was 4,200 U/L. Extensive tests for viral hepatitis, including anti-HAV, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, HBs antigen, anti-HCV, HCV-RNA, and anti-HEV, were negative, as were tests for human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus. Blood cultures were sterile. The autoimmune hepatitis panel, including anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), anti-liver-kidney microsomal (LKM) antibodies, and total immunoglobulin, was negative or within normal limits. Tests for genetic hemochromatosis were negative. Ceruloplasmin level was normal. Slit-lamp ophthalmologic examination did not reveal Kayser-Fleischer rings. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) with IV contrast and abdominal ultrasound with Doppler studies were unremarkable. Echocardiography was normal.
On day 3, the patient was transferred to an intensive care unit because of altered mental status, asterixis, and ammonia of 96 ¶æmol/L, findings consistent with grade III hepatic encephalopathy. The AST and ALT rose to ƒ?¾6,000 U/L (, column 5), and the hemoglobin declined to 5.5 g/dL, with severe melena from acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and development of borderline hypotension (Supplementary ). Bleeding was associated with 35,000 platelets/¶æL, prothrombin time >100 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time >124 seconds, D-dimer >9,999 ng/ml, and fibrinogen <35 mg/dL. Massive blood products were transfused. EGD, planned because of acute melena, and liver biopsy, planned for worsening liver failure, were both postponed due to hemodynamic instability and coagulopathy. Despite aggressive resuscitation, the patient rapidly deteriorated, suffered cardiac arrest, and expired.
The family consented to autopsy confined to liver, kidneys, lungs, and pancreas. Liver postmortem examination grossly revealed a golden-brown soft liver weighing 1,980 gm. Histopathologic hepatic examination revealed massive hepatocyte necrosis, occasional sparing of periportal hepatocytes, and diffuse sinusoidal congestion (Figures and ).

The patient was referred to the Oral Pathology Unit at the Faculty of Dentistry, Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro, in August 2019. The referring practitioner suspected squamous cell carcinoma. His past medical history was not relevant, and the patient was a nonsmoker and nonalcohol user. The patient had previously used a nocturnal bite to control bruxism. He reported a burning sensation in his mouth, local dysgeusia, and pain on the tip and on the right lingual border for 1 year. The patient also referred that he was unable to eat or drink any hot or spicy foods due to burning and pain on his tongue. He stated persistent hoarseness, sore throat, and difficulty sleeping due to continuous oral pain.
Extraoral examination was unremarkable, while intraoral examination revealed the presence of an ulcer and intense erythema of the tongue (Figures and ) and gingival edema and erythema (); however, the other parts of the oral mucosa was clinically normal. In the first place, several diagnostic hypotheses were proposed, most of them discarded for incompatibility with full blood count, serum B12 and folate, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, glucose, anti-nuclear antibody, and syphilis IgG that were normal or negative. The patient underwent an incisional biopsy under local anesthesia. The specimen was stored in a tube containing formalin 10% and sent to a laboratory for histopathological analysis. Microscopically, a large area of ulceration of the coating epithelium subtended by dense plasma cell infiltrate was observed (Figures and ). CD20 and CD3 showed focal positivity for B and T cells, respectively.

He had a medical history of acute coronary syndrome, for which he had received aspirin. His vital signs were as follows: respiratory rate, 22 breaths per minute; oxygen saturation on room air, 96%; systolic blood pressure, 125/67 mmHg; pulse rate, 88 beats per minute; and body temperature, 36.1 ¶øC. On arrival, the patient was diagnosed with multiple trauma including multiple rib fractures with hemothorax, lumbar fractures of the transverse process, and injuries to the right acetabulum, left adrenal gland, left ureter, and liver. His injury severity score was 22. We also found extravasation of the right superior gluteal artery and left adrenal gland. He was treated with a transfusion of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets, and the ratio was 12:26:30. He was administered 1 g tranexamic acid when he presented in this very acute phase. He also required intubation and transcatheter arterial embolization. There was no evidence of stray embolic materials in the external iliac arteries.
Laboratory test findings (normal ranges in parentheses) on hospital day 1 were as follows: white blood cells, 22.08 Ç? 103/×¬L (3.3ƒ??8.6 Ç? 103/×¬L); serum hemoglobin, 11.7 mg/dL (13.7ƒ??16.8 mg/dL); platelets, 136 Ç? 103/×¬L (158ƒ??348 Ç? 103/×¬L); serum creatinine kinase, 554 U/L (59ƒ??248 U/L); partial thromboplastin time, 37 s (25ƒ??38 s); international normalized ratio, 1.31; prothrombin time, 15.8 s (9.8ƒ??12.1 s); serum fibrinogen, 107 mg/dL (200ƒ??400 mg/dL); serum D-dimer, 155.7 ×¬g/mL (< 1.0 ×¬g/mL); and serum fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs), 305.5 ×¬g/mL (< 5.0 ×¬g/mL). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed mixed acidosis with an elevated serum lactate level (FiO2, 0.50; pH, 7.186; pCO2, 49.4 Torr; pO2 89.1 Torr; HCO3, 18 mmol/L; base excess ƒ?? 9.9; and lactate, 44 mg/dL).
On hospital day 2, his serum creatine kinase was markedly elevated to 22,001 U/L. At this point, his right lower leg showed signs of ischemia including lack of a pulse in the right dorsalis pedis artery and cold leg. These findings suggested arterial embolization in the right thigh, and 12 h after the injury, a right above-knee amputation was performed. However, the serum creatine kinase, 44,229 U/L and myoglobin levels, 67,000 ng/mL (< 110 ng/mL), were markedly high, even after the amputation, resulting in acute renal injury, which was treated via hemodiafiltration on hospital day 3. In addition, sustained low efficiency hemodialysis and plasma exchange were performed on hospital day 4. The patientƒ??s creatine kinase and myoglobin levels are plotted against his time course of treatment in Fig. . The changes in hemostatic markers are shown in Table . Despite these treatments, the patientƒ??s hemodynamic status, which included high catecholamine levels, did not improve, and he died on hospital day 8.
We performed an autopsy 50 h after his death. A general postmortem examination revealed pulmonary effusion and alveolar hemorrhage. Liver congestion and fatty liver were observed, as were tubular necrosis and nephrosclerosis in the kidney. There were also signs of arteriosclerosis in the aorta, common iliac arteries, and coronary artery. Necrosis was more severe in the left iliopsoas muscle than in the right. Although there were no signs of initial gastrointestinal tract injuries, irreversible ischemic colitis from the descending colon to the rectum was revealed. In addition, thrombus becoming fibrinized was detected in multiple organs in the autopsy specimen. (Fig. ). This may explain the peritonitis and sepsis, which resulted in continued shock and ultimately death.","[[83.0, 'year']]",M,3/2/2020,liver

The pain exhibited a gradual onset over 2 days, but was abruptly worsened following the simple task of tightening a screw with a screwdriver. His background was from a middle class family with no known risk of hereditary disease. He was in a stable relationship and the father of two children, both in their twenties, from a previous marriage. After completing high school he had earned a university degree in education of children with disabilities, which was also his current profession. His alcohol consumption was moderate and he did not smoke tobacco. Despite his relatively young age, his medical record contained a comprehensive list of previous diseases. At age 25 he underwent fundoplication because of gastric reflux. The procedure was repeated 3 years later due to persisting symptoms. At 29 he was diagnosed as having Hodgkinƒ??s lymphoma. He initially received combination chemotherapy of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, but this was terminated due to development of leg weakness. To compensate for chemotherapy intolerance, he subsequently received radiotherapy toward lymph nodes in his neck with a total of 40 gray. Consequently, he developed hypothyroidism as a side effect.
He had previously been on thyroid hormone replacement therapy for 7 years. During these years he had been changing the thyroxine medication from synthetic levothyroxine to a preparation derived from porcine thyroid glands, before ending up with a combination of the two. The previous 6 months he had expressed frustration over a general lack of well-being, claiming that the current thyroid hormone replacement therapy did not improve his symptoms. During several visits to his endocrinologist he had communicated a strong desire to discontinue thyroxine hormone replacement therapy completely, in order to see whether it would make him feel better. The idea was supported by his endocrinologist, provided that he, the patient, would be willing to control thyroid function every week, in collaboration with his general physician. In the months leading up to the decision to abandon levothyroxine therapy completely, our patientƒ??s medical record indicated that he was on a natural preparation derived from porcine thyroid glands corresponding to a daily dose of 19 ×¬g of levothyroxine and 4.5 ×¬g of liothyronine in addition to 50 ×¬g of levothyroxine 4 days a week and 25 ×¬g of levothyroxine the remaining 3 days. Approximately 3 months after he had in fact discontinued thyroxine hormone replacement therapy completely, he found himself being examined in the emergency unit because of acute severe pain in his right forearm. At the time of admission, his regular medication included esomeprazole 40 mg twice a day and 100 mg of ferrous sulfate once a day only.
During clinical examination in the emergency unit after midnight, severe pain was located on the dorsal side of his right forearm. His arm appeared swollen on examination, but the overlying skin was completely normal. A brief neurological examination revealed reduced sensibility to sensation on his right forearm compared to his left, especially on the ulnar side. Brachioradial reflexes were normal on both sides, whereas biceps and triceps reflexes were unsuccessfully elicited on either side. Reduced muscular power was described in his fingers and wrist on the right side, but our patient spontaneously disclosed that this was due to the pain being increased during contraction of these muscles. His blood pressure was 165/102 mmHg, pulse 90 beats/minute, respiratory rate 22 per/minute, and rectal temperature 37.0 ¶øC. He did not present any obvious symptoms or clinical signs frequently seen in hypothyroidism, such as lethargy, hair loss, cold intolerance, or myxedema. His creatinine kinase was elevated to 1659 IU/L (range 40ƒ??280). The results of a screening of blood tests including complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, and C-reactive protein were all within the reference range. The resident surgeon ordered overnight elevation of our patientƒ??s arm and opioid analgesics. Despite repeated administration of orally administered analgesics (1 g acetaminophen every 6 hours, 50 mg tramadol hydrochloride once) and intravenously administered opioid analgesics (5 mg oxycodone every 2 hours for 8 hours, followed by 5 mg morphine every 2 hours for 8 hours), he continued to complain of intense pain in his right forearm. The next morning a clinical evaluation of our patient revealed no improvement in pain or edema. His creatinine kinase had increased slightly to 1722 IU/L, and the surgeon on call diagnosed our patient as having compartment syndrome and referred him for immediate surgery. A preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which revealed edema in the extensor carpi ulnaris muscle (Fig. ), but no signs of an underlying process such as bleeding, tumor, or abscess. Complementary blood tests revealed a thyroid-stimulating hormone of 30.5 ×¬IU/ml (range 0.2ƒ??4.3) and free thyroxine of 7 ×¬mol/L (range 9ƒ??22), indicating hypothyroidism. A summary of the blood samples and their timing is provided in Table . After induction of general anesthesia by a combination of remifentanil (1 ×¬g/kg per minute), propofol (180 mg), succinylcholine (80 mg) and fentanyl (200 ×¬g), a straightforward fasciotomy was performed. The diagnosis of compartment syndrome was subsequently confirmed by the bulging of the affected muscle following opening of the fascia.
The surgery successfully removed the intense pain of our patientƒ??s forearm. However, a new problem surfaced in the postoperative ward, where he started complaining of similar intense pain in both calves, only a few hours after recovering from the forearm fasciotomy. Upon examination of his legs 3 hours after the forearm fasciotomy had been completed, his calf muscles appeared swollen, but soft and there was no clinical sign of compartment syndrome or myxedema. An ultrasound examination of his lower extremities was performed, but showed open deep veins bilaterally, excluding venous thrombosis as a source of the pain. The pain subsequently increased over the next few hours, but responded to elevation and opioid analgesics (5 mg oxycodone intravenously administered every 2 hours for 6 hours). The next morning, 18 hours after the forearm fasciotomy, the pain in his calves was still present but less severe and thyroid hormone replacement therapy was initiated with a levothyroxine dose of 50 ×¬g a day. Over the next few days the pain in his calves gradually subsided, before disappearing completely on day 3 after the surgery. The edema of his forearm muscle also diminished over the next few days and the skin was closed on day 6 after the fasciotomy.
Our patient was followed regularly by an endocrinologist after he was discharged from hospital. His thyroid function stabilized on a substitution regime of 10 ×¬g of liothyronine a day, in addition to 150 ×¬g of levothyroxine 4 days a week and levothyroxine 125 ×¬g the remaining 3 days of the week. Eight months after discharge he was seen by a neurologist. A full neurological examination only revealed normal findings, specifically demonstrating symmetrical and normal power, and normal sensation and function of his hand and wrist.","[[41.0, 'year']]",M,3/2/2020,liver

Bilateral diagnostic mammogram showed focal asymmetry measuring 1.5ƒ??cm in the right retroareolar region. Additional imaging by ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic mass measuring 1.1 Ç? 1.0 Ç? 1.0ƒ??cm in the right retroareolar breast, appearing to be contiguous with the nipple. This was reportedly palpable. No dominant mass, distortion, or suspicious calcifications were identified in the left breast. No adenopathy was seen.
Ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mass showed atypical glandular proliferation (). By immunohistochemistry, p63 immunoreactivity highlighted myoepithelial cells surrounding solid nests of atypical cells with a low to intermediate nuclear grade (). Focal and inconspicuous central necrosis was present (). Minute clusters of atypical cells devoid of myoepithelial cells were also identified. However, due to the background dense stroma, definitive characterization was not possible. Smooth muscle myosin (SMMS-1) immunohistochemical stain was negative for myoepithelial cells surrounding these nests, however, the staining pattern was considered to be secondary to attenuation of the myoepithelial cell cytoplasm. In addition, keratin (KRT) 5/6 immunohistochemical stain was diffusely positive throughout the atypical glandular proliferation (). As such, definitive diagnosis was deferred to the excisional specimen.
The patient subsequently had excisional biopsy of the right breast lesion with nipple-areolar complex removal. On gross examination, the nipple was everted and the areola was unremarkable. Serial sections revealed a tan-yellow to white densely fibrotic cut surface with the fibrotic area spanning 6ƒ??cm underlying the nipple. No distinct lesion was readily identified. Microscopic examination showed a well-circumscribed intermediate grade nodular tumor with pushing borders involving the base of the nipple and arrector pili muscle (). Expanded lobules of carcinoma in situ were seen with solid nests of polygonal cells that infiltrated the dermis and the breast emanating from the in situ component (-C). Though inconspicuous, the invasive component which consisted of both squamoid and ductal cell differentiation measured at least 10ƒ??mm. Upon further review, trichilemmal differentiation was identified by the presence of cells with pale to clear cytoplasm surrounded by a palisaded cell layer situated on top of a brightly eosinophilic basement membrane confirming the presence of an in situ adnexal component (). Foci of trichilemmal keratinization were also identified. Lymphovascular space invasion was absent. The tumor approached 2 of the resection margins.
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed, and a summary of the results is shown in . The tumor was positive for markers of basal differentiation including KRT5/6, KRT17, and KRT14. KRT8/18 stained most luminal cells in the in situ component and the central tumor cells in the infiltrating component of the tumor (). CD10 showed focal retained myoepithelial cells in the in situ component (). p63/keratin duo stain highlighted the basal and myoepithelial dual differentiation of tumor cells (). The tumor cells had absent staining for SMMS and calponin. Adipophilin staining pattern was nonspecific. Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 (TRPS1), mammaglobin, and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) were positive while gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15) was negative. The tumor was essentially negative for estrogen receptor (>1%), negative for progesterone receptor (0) and negative for Her 2 with a score of 0. Androgen receptor was also negative (0). High-risk and low-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) evaluation by in situ hybridization was negative in the tumor. Molecular testing by next-generation sequencing (Boston Gene tumor portrait) was notable for PTEN gene loss, PIK3CA R1 Q705HfS37 loss of function variant allele frequency (VAF 18.7%), CDKN2A/B loss, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I loss of heterozygosity with a tumor mutation burden of 0.59mut/Mb. Tumor origin was reported as most likely breast cancer with a prediction probability of 100%. The prediction probability was 93.2% for basal breast cancer and 63.5% for nonbasal breast cancer. However, the gene portrait could not differentiate basal breast cancer from cutaneous adnexal carcinoma.
As the tumor was likely to behave like specialized triple negative adnexal/salivary gland type carcinomas in the breast, a re-excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. Additional excision showed residual in situ and invasive carcinoma with histological features identical to the infiltrating component of the primary tumor. The invasive carcinoma was >2ƒ??mm from the new margin. Rare isolated tumor cells, which may have been introduced by the prior biopsy procedure, were identified in the right axillary sentinel lymph node. The patient subsequently received adjuvant radiation therapy and is currently doing well.","[[74.0, 'year']]",F,7/31/2023,cervical

The discharge was yellowish in color, nonfoul smelling, watery in consistency, and present all through the menstrual cycle. There was no history of itching in the perineal region, menstrual irregularity, dysuria, or dyspareunia. There was no history of pain lower abdomen or any bladder or bowel complaints. Her past history was significant in that she was HIV positive, acquired through a blood transfusion, and she had been on a combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine for the last 5 years. Her last CD-4 cell count was cell 534/×¬L. She was in chronic stage of HIV and has severe anemia (hemoglobin ƒ?? 6.5 g/dl) with reactive thrombocytosis (platelet count: 6.64 lakh/ml). The patient also had multinodular goiter with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Antithyroid peroxidase antibody titer was 135 IU/ml and anti-thyroglobulin antibody was 62.6 IU/ml. There was no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, or any other chronic medical disease.
On examination, her general condition was unremarkable, except for mild pallor. On local examination, the external genitalia were normal. On per speculum examination, the cervix looked hypertrophied with perioral erosion, and nabothian cyst, about 1 cm Ç? 1 cm at 11 oƒ?? clock position. Bleeding on contact was present. On application of acetic acid, there was thin acetowhite epithelium with irregular and geographical borders, with fine punctations (Grade 1 changes, as per 2011 IFCPC Nomenclature).

In the cervical examination, there was a polyp, which was biopsied. The Ethical Committee of Qom University of Medical Sciences approved the ethical consideration of this case by IR.MUQ.REC.1402.083 code at 22 Jul, 2023.
The pathology result showed an endocervical polyp with ulceration and inflammation and negative for dysplasia or malignancy and polypectomy.
The dimensions of the uterus were 62 mm Ç? 25 mm Ç? 32 mm in sonography and the ovaries were normal. The heteroechoic mass 45 Ç? 25 Ç? 20 contained vessels that filled the cervical canal and extended to the upper part of the vaginal canal. There was no evidence of the extension of this mass to the uterine cavity.
Abdominopelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reported that there was a 78 mm Ç? 68 mm Ç? 70 mm mass in the cervix. It showed a heterogeneous increased signal on T2-weighted image and heterogenic enhancing cystic, necrotize components. The post GD images extension into the proximal portion of vagina shows well defined T2 hypointense rim with bulge toward the parametrium and suspicion of parametrial invasion. The mass contained well-defined border with the uterus. However, mild widening of the endometrial cavity at the body of the uterus is visible with a maximum anteroposterior diameter of about 10 mm. Both ovaries were atrophic and no adnexal mass was seen. Large well defined heterogeneously enhancing mass at the uterine cervix is related to a carcinosarcoma with mild extension to the proximal endovaginal canal, and suspicion of early evidence of parametrial invasion []. The patient underwent curettage again; the result of endometrial curettage after 6 months was a fragment of endocervical polyps with chondroid metaplasia. Therefore, cervix adenosarcoma with heterologous elements chondroid differential diagnosis was done. The histological grade was low grade [].
The immunohistochemistry (IHC) was done and its results showed [] positive desmin, Myo D1, and cytoplasmic staining WT 1 and negative smooth muscle actin (SMA) with a diagnosis of ERMS (BOTRROID type) of the uterine cervix. IHC was positive results in CK, CYCLIN, DESIM, and PAX8 and negative in C-KIT, SMA, GATA-3, CD10, NAPSIN-A, and ER factors. Carcinoma with heterologous component ERMS was our final diagnosis []. The patient underwent four sessions of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AIM, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and mesna []. Then, the patient underwent surgery, so radical hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, lymphadenectomy, and omentum biopsy were done on June 2021. After the surgery, two sessions of brachytherapy with intracavitary technique and 28 sessions of radiotherapy with ISO gray system and conformal technique with 5040CGY were done. Furthermore, one session of adjuvant chemotherapy was done.
The pathological result after the surgery showed embryonic RMS with heterologous element []. Tumor size was at largest dimension of 5 cm with an additional dimension of 3.5 cm Ç? 3 cm. The tumor site was endocervix with extension to exocervix. Cervical stromal involvement was more than 50% of cervical thickness. No lymph node vascular invasion was seen. Endometrium showed cystic atrophy and myometrium had no specific pathological change. Omentum was mature adipose tissue with free from involvement that observed in the left and right obturator lymph node dissection.
MRI was conducted on March 2022 for comparison with previous MRI with and without contrast and showed salpingohysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy with no evidence of residual tumor at the surgical site and a small amount of free fluid in the pelvic. No significant pelvic lymph node was seen. A small amount of free fluid was noted in the pelvic cavity.

She had regular prenatal check-ups during pregnancy, with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes and G-6-PD deficiency. The patient had no history of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, or hepatitis before pregnancy and denied any family history of hereditary diseases. Before admission, her serum ferritin level was measured at 1910.84 ng/mL by routinely prenatal test. Upon admission, the patientƒ??s vital signs were recorded as follows: Temperature (T) - 36.4¶øC, Pulse rate (P) - 92 beats/minute, Respiratory rate (R) - 20 breaths/minute, Blood Pressure (BP) - 130/74 mmHg. No palpable enlargement of superficial lymph nodes was detected. On pelvic examination, the cervix was fully dilated at 10 cm, the amniotic membrane had ruptured, and the fetal presented as cephalic with a station of 2cm below the ischiatic spine. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.69Ç?109/L, hemoglobin (HGB) of 102 g/L, platelet count (PLT) of 259Ç?109/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 50 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 101 U/L, and fibrinogen (FIB) of 4.94 g/L. Following admission, dexamethasone was given via intramuscular injection to promote fetal lung maturation and cefazolin sodium pentahydrate was administrated for anti-infective treatment. The patient delivered a baby girl weighing 1300 g, with Apgar scores of 8-9-9. However, several hours later, the patient started experiencing recurrent chills and fever, with a maximum temperature of 40.0¶øC. Although we upgraded antibiotics to strengthen anti-infection and antiviral treatment, the patient continued to have a fever for 8 days. The patient had no other clinical manifestations of systemic infection except for fever. Due to the unclear cause of the fever, a multidisciplinary team (MDT) composed of experts in obstetrics, hematology, rheumatology, respiratory medicine, endocrinology, critical care medicine, and genetic and genomic medicine was consulted to analyze the patientƒ??s condition. Improved examinations were provided based on the MDT consultation (). With recurrent fever (temperature ƒ?¾38.5¶øC for over 7 days), leukopenia, decreased hemoglobin, elevated triglycerides, decreased fibrinogen, elevated ferritin, decreased NK cell count, and reduced NK cell activity, along with increased soluble CD25 levels, and NK cell CD107a degranulation assay suggesting impaired NK cell function (), a diagnosis of HLH was considered. Accordingly, the patient was admitted to Hematology Department for bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The examination revealed the tissue hemophagocytosis (). The patient had elevated levels of sCD25 (2170.72 U/mL), and the NK cell CD107a degranulation assay showed functional impairment of NK cell degranulation, which supported the diagnosis of HLH. Two days after MDT consultation, the patient received dexamethasone (16 mg, once daily), and then twenty-four hours later, the patientƒ??s temperature returned to normal. The dose of dexamethasone was adjusted according to the patientƒ??s condition (). At the same time of treatment, the etiology of the patientƒ??s HLH was examined. The pathogen screening tests showed that influenza A and B viruses, human parvovirus DNA (B19-DNA), CMV-DNA, and EBV-DNA were negative, so viral infection was not supported; fungal ×ý-D glucan assay (G test), GM test and fungal culture showed no abnormality, hence no obvious fungal infection; Autoantibody spectrum (including ANA, anti-dsDNA, ACA, nRNP/Sm, Sm, SSA, R0-52, SSB, ScI-70, Jo-1, CENP) B, anti-dsDNA, Nucleosome, Histone, Rib.P-Prot.pANCA, cANCA, MPO-ANCA, PR3-ANCA, etc.), complement C3 and C4, immunoglobulin G4 was not abnormal.

The lesion had several episodes of infection, becoming inflamed, purulent, and bleeding with irritation of the peri-lesional skin, which prompted the patient to seek medical attention. Dermatological examination revealed a well-defined irregularly shaped ulceration, roughly oval, with a budding surface in some areas and fibrino-purulent surface in others, sharp-edged borders, and a surrounding erythematous-violaceous rim. The lesion measured 15 cm in the longest axis. The peri-lesional skin was erythematous, infiltrated, erosive in some areas, and dotted with pustules in others.
Breast tumor origin was ruled out after ultrasound and mammography examinations. Clinical suspicion was focused on Pagetƒ??s disease, infiltrating BCC, ulcerated pigmented squamous cell carcinoma, or porocarcinoma. A biopsy of the ulcer margins was performed, and histopathological analysis showed a well-demarcated proliferation of tumor lobules with large cells having abundant basophilic cytoplasm and moderately atypical nuclei arranged in a palisading pattern at the periphery.
