Upon further questioning, he reported pleuritic chest pain described as sharp, worsening on deep inspiration with no alleviating factors, and scored 6 out of 10 on a pain scale. He also reported dyspnoea and shortness of breath on exertion. He denied haemoptysis, pyrexia, infective symptoms, weight loss, calf pain, prolonged immobility, recent long-haul flights, history of malignancy or recent surgery. Past medical history was significant for hypertension, bilateral cataracts, and glaucoma. His regular medications included latanoprost eye drops in both eyes, irbesartan 300 mg once daily (OD), azarga drops in both eyes bis in die (BD), travoprost one drop in both eyes OD, sertraline 50 mg OD, atenolol 75 mg OD, amlodipine 10 mg OD, and bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg OD. There was no family history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. He was independent of activities of daily living and mobility, was an ex-smoker with a 15-pack-year history and denied any alcohol use.
The Initial assessment revealed that the patient was comfortable at rest, with no cyanosis or respiratory distress. Clinical examination showed a National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) score of 4, the airway was patent, and the trachea was central. The chest was clear on auscultation and resonant with percussion. The oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry was 94% with 2 L/minute of supplementary oxygen, and the respiratory rate was 18. Heart sounds were normal, pulse was regular at 108 bpm, capillary refill was 3 s centrally, and blood pressure was 190/115 mmHg. Glasgow coma scale score was 15, blood glucose level was 9.1, and temperature was 36.7C. The remaining physical examination results were unremarkable. The patient’s Coronavirus Disease 2019 polymerase chain reaction test results were negative. The laboratory values and arterial blood gas results are presented in Table and Table , respectively. Electrocardiography revealed normal sinus tachycardia, left axis deviation, right bundle branch block and S1Q3T3 (Figure ).
Chest radiography findings were normal, and the patient did not show any signs of infection. In the absence of any convincing signs of infection, oxygen requirement and ECG changes, the patient under CTPA demonstrated pulmonary emboli within the right lower lobe segmental artery, extending into the bilateral basal segmental branch and posterior basal segmental branch (Figure ). There were no features of right-sided heart strain. He received a treatment dose of enoxaparin at 1.5 mg/kg dose of 160 mg enoxaparin once daily. Echocardiography was performed the following day to assess right heart pressures and to rule out any cardiac cause for pulmonary embolism, which showed normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55% and no evidence of right heart strain.
He was successfully discharged with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily on Day 5 and was referred to the respiratory outpatient clinic for follow-up. He was reviewed in the respiratory outpatient clinic and advised lifelong anticoagulation with rivaroxaban for an unprovoked pulmonary embolism following a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis, excluding malignancy.","[[76.0, 'year']]",M,2023-11-26,heart,"ECG Features of Pulmonary Embolism in a Patient With Normal D-Dimer and Hypoxia We present the case of a 76-year-old male who presented to our hospital with a two-week history of non-radiating right-sided chest pain.

41283,5578540-1,29201706,oa_comm/PMC005xxxxxx/PMC5578540.xml,A Case Report of Ulcerative Colitis Induced by Therapy of Colorectal Carcinoma,"A 59-year-old female patient was admitted with history of abdominal pain for a year and rectal bleeding for a month. At colonoscopy, a tumor mass in scirrhous feature, narrowing the lumen and complicating the passage of the endoscope, was detected on sigmoid colon. Mucosa was normal through the last 10 cm of terminal ileum and the entire colon except tumoral tissue detected at sigmoid colon (). Pathological finding of the biopsy specimens obtained from the mass was reported as colorectal carcinoma (). At computed tomography (CT), asymmetric wall thickening on the rectosigmoid region, pollution of the adjacent mesenteric fat tissue and millimetric lymph nodes were observed. Low anterior resection was performed and pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with intact borders. Tumor was determined as T3N0M0. Oral capecitabine 3 gm/day for 14 days per month was administered. Two months later, she was admitted to the medical oncology clinic with complaint of a bloody diarrhea and bowel frequency of approximately 10 times/day. Fever and tachycardia was determined at physical examination. Other biochemical parameters were normal with erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 45 mm/hour. Stool examination revealed abundant leukocytes and erythrocytes with no parasitic cysts and ova. Oral capecitabine therapy was stopped. Intravenous ciprofloxacin and metronidazole treatments were administered. However, symptoms of the patients were not resolved on the seventh day of treatment (hemoglobin: 8.4 gm/dl, white blood cells: 5000/mm3, platelets: 283,000/mm3), colonoscopy was performed. On colonoscopy, although mucosa of the terminal ileum was normal, the mucosa of the cecum, ascending, transverse and descending colons and rectosigmoid region was hyperemic, edematous, spontaneous fragile and erosive (). The biopsy specimens obtained from the colonic mucosa was compatible with chronic active colitis with distinct inflammation, moderate activation, crypt abscess, distortion and destruction (). Diagnosis was considered as ulcerative pan colitis with severe clinical and endoscopic activation. Clinic remission was achieved with oral mesalazine 4 gm/day, mesalazine enema 4 gm/ day and metilprednisolone 32 mg/day. After induction of remission metilprednisolone was tapered and stopped. Oral mesalazine 4 gm/day and mesalazine enema 4 gm/ day were chosen for maintenance therapy. Colonoscopy 1 year after the low anterior resection revealed normal colo-nic mucosa with no recurrence of colorectal carcinoma.
Pathophysiology of the ulcerative colitis includes genetic susceptibility influenced by the luminal microbiota, which provides antigens and adjuvants that stimulate either pathogenic or protective immune responses. Environmental triggers as diet, the use of antibiotics and nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, colonic ischemia stress or infection are necessary to initiate or reactivate disease.
Takakura et al reported an ulcerative colitis case occurring 10 days after resection for sigmoid colon cancer and reviewed 8 other ulcerative colitis cases in the literature triggered by surgery for colorectal carcinoma. Interval for development of ulcerative colitis has been shown between 2 weeks and 8 years. While region that the colorectal carcinoma originates was sigmoid colon at 4 cases, rectum was the site of colorectal carcinoma at 4 cases. Surgical procedures were low anterior resection or sigmoidectomy. Chemotherapy background of the cases was indefinite.
To date only two definitive reasons were given for a direct relationship between the colonic operation and the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Takakura et al postulated that an ischemic condition induced by the operation might have caused the development of ulcerative colitis. In fact, it has been reported that the connection of microcirculation could be the etiology of ulcerative colitis, or strong emotional stress from the operation may be the cause as some reports suggest that psychological stress might lead to the pathogenesis, exacerbation, or relapse of ulcerative colitis, possibly triggering 40% of all cases of ulcerative colitis; Lim et al postulated that diversion colitis might have caused the development of ulcerative colitis as leukocytes were sensitized and activated in the vasculature of the inflamed diverted colon, circulated and recruited to the mucosa through the phenotypically similar vascular endothelium of the instream large intestine, finally causing an inflammatory process, which developed into ulcerative colitis.
Another possibility is the presence of silent microscopic colitis as the etiological factor of colorectal carcinoma and triggering of manifest ulcerative colitis by perioperative factors. Katsanos et al reported a case of a silent ulcerative colitis adjacent to a regular sigmoid carcinoma. In his case at colonoscopy tumor mass was seen and the remaining colon mucosa was normal. Ulcerative colitis was detected on pathologic examination. This case may indicate that a normal looking mucosal ulcerative colitis increases the risk of colon cancer.
Capecitabine is an orally administered prodrug of 5-fluorouracil commonly used in the treatment of advanced breast cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and esophageal cancer. Capecitabine induced colitis is rare with only four cases have been reported in the literature. The mechanism leading to colitis with ischemic features is unclear. Vasoconstriction induced colonic ischemia, mesenteric artery thrombosis due to injury to the endothelium and disruption of factors involved in fibrinolysis, direct mucosal injury and shift in intestinal micro flora which leads to activation of proinflammatory cytokines that results in mucosal necrosis may be the contributing factors.
Except adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, the case we present; location of the tumor, interval for development of ulcerative colitis and surgical procedure for treatment of colorectal carcinoma were similar with the cases described in literature. Factors triggering ulcerative colitis after treatments for colorectal cancer might be the presence of silent microscopic colitis, capecitabine induced colonic ischemia and perioperative stress factors.","[[59.0, 'year']]",F,2015,heart,"A Case Report of Ulcerative Colitis Induced by Therapy of Colorectal Carcinoma A 59-year-old female patient was admitted with history of abdominal pain for a year and rectal bleeding for a month.

The fever was low grade per patient and was associated with chills, night sweats, anorexia, and nausea with occasional episodes of non-bilious non-bloody vomiting. He had an unintentional weight loss of about 30 pounds over the last two months. He also reported non-bloody diarrhea for the same duration. He denied any significant abdominal pain or tenesmus. He also reported having similar symptoms of lesser severity every year around springtime for over 20 years. He had not sought medical attention for his symptoms prior to the current visit and relied on home and herbal remedies to relieve symptoms before. His past medical history was significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He did not have any significant surgical history. Social history included occasional binge alcohol drinking, with the last use being two weeks prior to presentation, but no history of smoking, illicit drug use, or sexually transmitted diseases. The family history was negative for any known malignancy or hematologic disorder.
On initial assessment, the patient was febrile (temperature 38.7 °C) with a blood pressure of 123/75 mmHg, a heart rate of 98 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. He was oriented to time, place, and people. He had bilateral vesicular breathing on lung auscultation with no additional sounds. A cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. An abdominal examination revealed a non-tender belly with no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly. The neurological examination was unremarkable.
His initial laboratory workup revealed transaminitis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), high C-reactive protein (CRP), and hyperferritinemia with a ferritin level >200,000 ng/ml. This has been presented in Table .
An X-ray of the chest was negative for any acute pathology, and an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 59%. As shown in Figure , computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed a fatty liver with possible cirrhosis, a normal spleen, and mild retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
The blood culture, urine culture, and serologies for tick-borne diseases and hepatitis panel were negative. The results were negative for antinuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody, ceruloplasmin, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) level tests. Peripheral blood smears did not reveal any atypical cells. Ultrasound of the abdomen and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed a normal liver and pancreas without evidence of obstruction.
The size and location of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes were small and not amenable to biopsy. Due to persistent fevers and transaminitis, the patient was started on empiric treatment with doxycycline for suspected leptospirosis and tick-borne diseases, but no clinical improvement was noted after five days. Kikuchi Fujimoto syndrome was one of the differentials given lymphadenopathy, fevers, night sweats, and abdominal pain. Despite optimal treatment, the patient remained febrile with worsening transaminitis. A bone marrow (BM) biopsy was performed, but the results came back as inconclusive.
On day 8 of admission, he became hypotensive and required management in the intensive care unit (ICU). His labs showed worsening pancytopenia with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.1. Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen (EBV-VCA) IgG was found to be elevated (164 U/ml), and EBV DNA came back positive with 71171 copies/ml. These labs indicate EBV reactivation without any known cause. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem 1 g IV thrice a day, doxycycline 100 mg IV twice a day, and antivirals including ganciclovir 365 mg IV twice a day. Due to the high clinical suspicion of HLH, he was started on a pulse dose of methylprednisolone 1 g once a day for three days. Thereafter, an improvement in ESR, CRP, and serum ferritin was noted, and the patient became afebrile.
A repeat BM biopsy confirmed the presence of hemophagocytosis, and a formal diagnosis of HLH was made. His ferritin level normalized and, on day 15 of hospitalization, the patient was discharged home on a tapering dose of oral prednisone with the final diagnosis of EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. IL-2 receptor alpha (CD25) soluble level came back as 10,700 pg/mL (normal 532-1892 pg/mL), which was high and favored the diagnosis of HLH. The patient was followed up in the clinic, and prednisone was tapered off slowly over five months with significant improvement in symptoms.

She had a past medical history of Crohn's disease. Additionally, she was on oral prednisone 30 mg daily and oral 6-mercaptopurine 25 mg daily. Seventeen days before admission, she had started taking adalimumab. On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 39.8°C, blood pressure of 133/94 mm Hg, heart rate of 122 beats/min, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 20% in room air. Apart from that, she had signs of toxicity, confusion, and nuchal rigidity. Due to the patient's discomfort, the tests for Kernig's sign and Brudzinski's sign were not performed.
A neurological examination revealed neither central nervous system (CNS) deficits nor focal deficits. For laboratory data, complete blood count was notable for leukocytosis of 12.7 k/mL with bandemia (band neutrophils 15%), hemoglobin 14.5%, hematocrit 42.5 g/dL, and platelet count 151,000/µL. Her comprehensive metabolic panel was remarkable for hyponatremia (serum sodium 132 mmol/L), hypochloremia (chloride 87 mmol/L), anion gap metabolic acidosis (anion gap 25 mmol/L and carbon dioxide 20 mmol/L), lactic acidosis (lactic acid 2.53 mmol/L), and hyperglycemia (glucose 142 mg/dL). By lumbar puncture we could extract 1.5 mL of turbid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); CSF analysis showed white blood cell count 2,300 cells/mL (48% segmented neutrophils, 6% lymphocytes, and 43% monocytes), red blood cell count 130 cells/mL, glucose 44 mg/dL, and protein 216 mg/dL. CSF stain revealed Gram-positive coccobacilli, the patient was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin. At the same time, 6-mercaptopurine and adalimumab were discontinued immediately together with tapering off prednisone. Consequently, the patient's mental status improved on the next day despite persistent headache and fever with a body temperature of 37.8°C. Since both blood and CSF culture were positive for LM, vancomycin and ceftriaxone were hence discontinued; the patient eventually defervesced.
Then, the initial MRI of the brain came back showing a 5 × 5 mm ring-enhancing lesion in the left temporal lobe with surrounding increased T2 and FLAIR signal consistent with brain abscess (Fig. ). The patient was discharged on day 7 of hospitalization with ampicillin 2 g intravenously every 4 h for a total of 2 weeks. The follow-up MRI at 2 weeks after the initial treatment of ampicillin revealed decreasing signs of a ring-enhancing lesion in the left temporal lobe (Fig. ). After completing 3 weeks of ampicillin, the patient received an additional week of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 10 mg/kg/day.

98572,8820920-1,35140992,oa_comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8820920.xml,A Case of Nonpuerperal Uterine Inversion Caused by Cervical Cancer,"A 67-year-old woman (gravida 2, para 2) was evaluated for a mass in her right breast and was diagnosed with right breast cancer at another center. She was referred to our hospital for the management of a uterine mass that was detected on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) during a search for metastasis. Her medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. She had no family history of malignancy.
On admission, we observed mild vaginal bleeding. A gynecological examination and transvaginal ultrasonography showed a tumor sized 80 × 60 × 40 mm. Biochemical marker analysis showed an elevated hemoglobin A1c level of 8.0%, a neuron-specific enolase level of 28.2 ng/mL, and a squamous cell carcinoma- (SCC-) associated antigen level of 11.2 ng/mL (normal <1.5 ng/mL). Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an irregular mass in the uterine cavity that had spread to the vaginal cavity, predominantly occupying the uterine corpus, causing uterine inversion (Figures and ). No bladder or rectal infiltration was observed, but the right obturator lymph node was enlarged to a diameter of 2 cm. Parametrium infiltration was unclear, but the cardinal ligaments seemed to be compressed due to the tumor. No disseminated nodules or ascites were observed. In addition, distant metastases were not observed on CT. Tumor tissue biopsy detected SCC with small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC). Preoperatively, a diagnosis of endometrial cancer was considered. Considering the size and localization of the tumor, extended abdominal hysterectomy was planned.
On laparotomy, the uterus was inverted. The fundus was depressed, and the bilateral round ligaments and adnexa had retracted (). The tumor had replaced the cervix and infiltrated the upper one-third of the posterior vaginal wall. Infiltration into the right parametrium was remarkable, and the right obturator lymph node was enlarged to a diameter of 2 cm. The cardinal ligaments were invaded, but the tumor was not extended to the pelvic wall. Extended abdominal hysterectomy, which included resection of the infiltrated vaginal wall and parametrium as well as the enlarged obturator lymph node, was performed. The total operation time was 5 h and 19 min, and the blood loss was 2,116 mL. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from our hospital 8 days postoperatively without further complications.
The tumor measured 83 × 62 × 40 mm in size, and the cervix was deformed with a mass involving the corpus (). The uterine serosa at the fundus was inverted due to traction by the tumor. Vaginal wall infiltration and right parametrial infiltration were observed, and the margin was partially positive. A histopathological examination showed that the main component was SCC, and approximately 20% of the tumor was SCNEC (Figures and ). The epithelial structure of the cervix was partially preserved in the high-grade squamous intraepithelial (HSIL) lesion. HSIL, SCC, and SCNEC were present simultaneously. In addition, immunohistochemically, p16 was diffusely positive, suggesting human papillomavirus infection (). Furthermore, the tumor was negative for estrogen receptor, suggesting that the tumor had not originated from the endometrium () and was considered to have formed in the cervix. Immunostaining showed CD56 positivity and synaptophysin positivity (Figures and ). Both the SCC and SCNEC components had metastasized to the submitted right obturator lymph node. The patient was diagnosed with cervical cancer and SCC with SCNEC, Stage IIIC1 (pT2bN1M0).
Surgery for right breast cancer was performed 1 month after the abdominal surgery. Although the cancer was an invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, it was strongly positive for estrogen receptor and was a separate tumor entity from uterine cancer. The postoperative treatment of the uterine tumor was decided in accordance with the treatment of SCNEC, considering that SCNEC has a high risk for local recurrence and metastasis and occupied 20% of the cervical cancer. Postoperative chemotherapy (etoposide, 100 mg/m2 on days 1–3 + cisplatin, 80 mg/m2 on day 1: six courses) was performed instead of concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) []. Follow-up examinations, including vaginal examination, monitoring of tumor marker levels, and CT for follow-up of the chemotherapy for cervical cancer, have not shown tumor recurrence until 1 year postoperatively.

Family history was irrelevant for specific neurologic disorders and in the child previous neurologic manifestations were denied. He is the first child and the older sister is healthy. At the conception the mother was 27 years old and the father 29. The mother denied to have had infectious diseases and to have used drugs or alcohol during the gestation. Fetal movements were regularly felt and fetal ultrasound examination was normal. The child was born at term by spontaneous delivery with birth weight of 2.800 gr, height 49 cm and head circumference of 35 cm (all within normal range). Neonatal period was uneventful and developmental steps reached regularly for the age. The parents complained that the child suffered by frequent airway infections. Vaccinations were regularly conducted. He attended primary school with good results. Soon after the admission the child was submitted to treatment with i.v. midazolam (0.4 mg/Kg/hours) in a tempt to stop the seizures, but the seizures were persistent and more frequent in spite of the repeated i.v. midazolam treatment. At physical examination no malformation anomalies were observed. The ear, heart, respiratory tract, and abdominal organs were normal. Upon the neurologic examination the child was pained with feeble voice in the interval between the seizures. Patellar reflexes were particularly expressed. Fundus examination was normal. Hematologic findings including blood count, electrolytes, plasma and urine amino acids, thyroid testing, organic acids, plasma purine, and total cholesterol were normal. Hematologic results for viral infections were negative. The EEG recording showed the presence of spike and waves particularly evident in the fronto-temporal regions. The Brain MRI was not indicative. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed normal color, number of cells, glucose, proteins and albumin. CSF antibodies against GABA A, GABA B, LGI1, and NMDAR were negative and CSF polymerase chain reaction analyses were negative for viral agents. A new EEG showed diffuse delta-theta background.

Her routine antenatal bloods and screening investigations were normal. She was commenced on progesterone pessaries at 24 weeks for a short cervix. Regular ultrasounds were performed as part of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy monitoring.

All Doppler studies and amniotic fluid levels remained normal throughout, including at an ultrasound performed early during the 35th week. The patient presented a few days later in preterm labour and underwent an emergency caesarean section for fetal distress of Twin A. Twin A was born with no signs of life, profound anaemia (haemoglobin 21) and was unable to be resuscitated. Twin B was delivered with no complications.

The patient was complaining of a vague abdominal pain for the last month that had intensified in the last couple of days. On initial examination, he was hemodynamically stable with a soft non-distended abdomen that was tender to palpation in the left lower quadrant. A slightly elevated white blood cell count of 17.79 × 109/L and elevated C- reactive protein level of 236 mg/L (normal range, 0-5 mg/L) or 22247 nmol/L (range, 0.76-28.5 nmol/L) were measured in venous samples. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed extensive atherosclerosis of abdominal aorta and an infrarenal aneurysm 40-mm transverse diameter and 6-cm length (). Aneurysm had a slightly hyperdense thrombosed crescentic portion with 11-mm diameter. In continuation with the thrombosed aneurysm, a soft tissue density was extending anteriorly. The soft tissue density was adherent to the duodenum and was slightly compressing it. With a suspected diagnosis of intramural hematoma and contained aneurysm rupture, conventional angiography of aorta was performed. Angiography confirmed abdominal aorta aneurysm and showed no contrast extravasation. The patient was prescribed pentoxifylline and coraspin and was discharged. One month later, the patient presented with mild-to-moderate hematemesis and severe abdominal pain, accompanied by tenderness to palpation with positive rebound in left lower quadrant. A nasogastric tube initially drained only gastric contents. During follow-up, the patient had an episode of melena and positive results in nasogastric lavage. A contrast enhanced CT showed an infrarenal aneurysm 50 mm in transverse diameter and 6 cm in length with the progression of mural thrombus to a diameter of 2 cm. Marked compression of small intestine, anterosuperior to aneurysm, and small air bubbles within thrombus were noted (). With a suspected diagnosis of AEF, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was planned.

He had history of herpes encephalitis and epilepsy and was not on any other medication apart from carbamazepine for his epilepsy. He did not have any seizures recently, and there was no history of trauma. There was no previous history of muscle disease or muscle weakness. He was completely mobile till the occurrence of this current illness. On examination he was febrile, with a normal capillary refill and blood pressure. He had a few infected blisters on his legs. There were no signs and symptoms suggestive of alcohol intoxication. There was generalized tenderness over his muscles, and he could not bear weight without support because of myalgia. Findings from his neurological examination were completely normal, including tendon reflexes and fundoscopy. He had normal heart sounds with no murmurs, his chest was clear, his abdomen was soft and there was no hepatosplenomegaly.
His urine dipstick showed 3+ blood, and subsequent laboratory testing confirmed it as myoglobin. He had a raised C-reactive protein (CRP) of 225 U/L and a raised creatine kinase of 9982 U/L. He was initially started on cefotaxime, which was changed to more specific flucloxacillin and rifampicin once the initial blood culture grew Staphylococcus aureus (sensitive to flucloxacillin). His creatine kinase reached a peak value of 12156 U/L on day 2 of admission, with a gradual fall over the next few days, reaching a normal level by day 7 of admission. The myalgia improved gradually, he started bearing weight after 2 to 3 days and was completely mobile by day 5 of admission. He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital stay without any evidence of shock. His renal functions were normal, apart from slightly raised urea, viz., 9.4, which settled with adequate intravenous hydration.
On day 4 of admission, he developed a heart murmur; and in view of persisting pyrexia, he underwent an echocardiogram, which showed large vegetation on the septal leaflet of tricuspid valve. Gentamicin was added; however, even after 2½ weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy, he continued to have high-grade fever. Both the fever and the inflammatory markers settled once the vegetation was surgically removed.
He received antibiotics for a total 6 weeks (4 weeks IV and 2 weeks oral). The vegetation did not grow any bacteria, and the histology was consistent with infective endocarditis.

He had consulted two days earlier at a different health centre and was prescribed an anti-inflammatory and anti spasmodic. He reported no improvements. He was a former smoker, weaned for 10 years, and had a history of hypothyroidism treated with Levothyroxine.
Physical examination on admission found coldness and paresis of the right ankle and foot, associated with the absence of popliteal, posterior and pedal tibia pulses. The left leg showed no anomaly. His abdomen was sensitive but without signs of peritonitis. Blood pressure was 138/85 mmHg with sinus tachycardia at 134 beats/min.
Arterial and venous Duplex ultrasonography of the lower limb, showed thrombosis of the popliteal arteries and tibial tripod. There were no signs of deep venous thrombosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed neither valvular nor intra cavitary anomalies. Ventricular ejection fraction was preserved. Laboratory tests noted elevated muscle enzymes; ASAT at 297 IU/L, CPK 11902 IU/L, LDH at 623 IU/L, (troponin I was normal), white blood cells (WBC) count at 13×109/L and high C-reactive protein (CRP) level at 500 mg/L. Renal function was impaired; urea 13.6 mmol/l, creatinine 221 μmol/l, measured creatinine clearance at 27 ml/min. His diuresis was conserved. Coagulation and crasis tests were normal. Blood samples were taken for assessment of thrombophilia (protein S, protein C, Antithrombin III).
Embolectomy of the sub articular popliteal artery was performed under local anaesthesia. Fresh thrombus was extracted from the popliteal artery with recovery of good flows. But embolectomy of the leg arteries revealed an old and adhering thrombus with poor reflux. Fasciotomy of the leg completed the surgery. He was subsequently admitted in intensive care (ICU) and received sodium heparin (500 IU/Kg/24 h) using an automatic syringe, antibiotics, an analgesic and a proton pump inhibitor (PPIs). Oral feeding was stopped.
The next morning, coldness of the left lower limb was found with the abolition of the distals pulses. We realized a thoraco-abdominal and lower limb angio CT. It showed the thoracic aorta of normal size with no parietal atherosclerotic lesion and containing a thrombus measuring 43 mm whose upper pole was located at 15 mm of the aortic isthmus (Figure A, B, E), and signs of renal and splenic infarction, very thin colonic wall not enhanced by the contrast agen, suggestive of ischemia (Figure B, C). The arteries of the lower limbs were occluded beginning at the popliteal artery (Figure ).
Surgical treatment of the aortic thrombus was proposed, but patient and his family who were made aware of the surgical risks refused. The dose of heparin was increased (700 IU/Kg/24 h), associated with Naftidrofuryl (Praxilene® 200 mg) 2 tablets/8 h. On D4, amputation of the right thigh was carried out because of the extension of the lesions on this limb, a constant hyperleukocytosis and a high CRP level. However the coldness of the lower left limb had disappeared.
From D10 we finally began the introduction of oral anticoagulation (OAC) by vitamin K antagonists, Acenocoumarol (sintrom® 4 mg). INR target (2–3) was obtained after 3 days of overlap. We didn’t introduce them earlier because the surgical option was not abandoned and the decision for medical treatment had not yet been taken. Renal function was stabilized, as well as WBC count and CRP levels. TEE could not be realized due to technical reasons, so we did another CT scan (Figure ), which showed the persistence of intra aortic thrombus, pleural effusions, and the appearance of thrombus tracks in the right and left pulmonary artery branches.
At D21, his condition improved and he was transferred to the inpatient ward. One week later, at his request, he was discharged but kept under treatment, which comprised of OAC, antiplatelet and statin for hypercholesterolemia discovered during his hospitalization.
A new thrombophilia assessment was carried on consultation at the department of Internal Medicine. No abnormalities were found.

She had received 13 days of daptomycin at the time of presentation. She had no other new medication or supplement. In the emergency department (ED), the patient was hypoxemic with oxygen saturation of 90% on 3 liters per minute (lpm) of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable but ill-appearing with moderate respiratory distress. She had decreased air entry bilaterally and absent wheeze with a normal heart exam and no cardiac murmur. There was left lower extremity with mild edema, clean surgical incision on the left thigh at the site of the abscess and the rest of the examination was unremarkable.
Investigations
Laboratory testing including a complete blood count (hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL; white cells: 9.32 K/uL with absolute eosinophils 0.35 K/uL (3.8%); platelets: 233 K/uL; serum biochemistries (sodium: 136 mmol/L; potassium: 3.2 mmol/L; chloride: 100 mmol/L; bicarbonate: 23 mmol/L; blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 21 mg/dL; creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL, which was elevated from a baseline of 0.8 mg/dL but reduced compared to discharge creatinine 1.8 mg/dL; glucose: 110 mg/dL), troponin (high sensitivity troponin T: 22 ng/L), creatine kinase level 25 U/L, procalcitonin 0.52 ng/mL, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 286 pg/mL. Respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), including testing for COVID-19, was negative. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella antigen were negative. Blood cultures showed no growth. Chest radiography (CXR) demonstrated retrocardiac opacity and faint airspace opacity in the left upper lung. Computed Tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest ruled out pulmonary embolism but was notable for small consolidations of the right lower lobe, and large posterior consolidations in the left lung reported as likely pneumonic infiltrates (Figure ). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed no structural or valvular abnormalities and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55%.
Treatment
The patient received a single dose of 40 mg oral prednisone in the ED, which was discontinued due to low suspicion of airway reactive disease. Antibiotic therapy with intravenous (IV) piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated in the ED given the possibility of pneumonia. Linezolid was instituted in place of daptomycin to continue treatment for the recent MRSA bacteremia. The piperacillin-tazobactam was then discontinued the next day with a decision to monitor clinically since there was a very low suspicion for pneumonia based on lack of fever, productive cough, and normal white blood cell count.
Outcome and Follow-Up
The patient was transitioned from 3 to 2 lpm on a nasal cannula. She was discharged to a skilled nursing facility on oral linezolid and oxygen supplementation. The pulmonary infiltrates resolved once daptomycin was stopped and eosinophils decreased from 0.35 K/uL on admission to 0.24 K/uL on discharge.","[[74.0, 'year']]",F,2023-05-28,heart,"Daptomycin-Induced Pulmonary Toxicity: A Case Series A 74-year-old non-smoker female with a history of peripheral vascular disease, systemic hypertension, prior pulmonary embolism, dyslipidemia, and psoriatic arthritis presented with progressive shortness of breath, lethargy, and weakness for two days.

She denied any tobacco use or alcohol consumption, but she mentioned allergies to doxycycline and amoxicillin. No deterioration of renal or cardiac function had been reported in her previous medical examinations. Family history was unremarkable, too.
She had received the first and second doses of BNT162b2 vaccine for COVID-19 in June 20XX. On July 8, 20XX, she noticed that her neck had become thicker, so she visited a local cardiologist on July 15; furosemide 40 mg per day was prescribed for suspected renal and cardiac insufficiency.
On July 26, she consulted the local urologist, who prescribed azosemide 30 mg, although no improvement in her oedema was observed.
On July 29, she was referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment for suspected heart failure and she was admitted for further diagnostic testing and treatment because of marked oedema, worsening renal function with serum creatinine 1.98 mg/dL and a decreased platelet count of 4.0 × 104 /μL.
On admission, her clinical findings were as follows: blood pressure, 112/92 mmHg; heart rate, 96/min; axillary temperature, 37.1 °C; body height, 153 cm; and body weight, 44.7 kg (body mass index 19.1 kg/m2).
She had severe oedema of the lower extremities and superficial lymph nodes in the cervical, axillary and inguinal regions could be palpated.
No arthralgias, neurologic findings, or skin lesions were noted. Furthermore, heart and lung examinations were normal.
Blood test results on admission showed renal dysfunction, low platelets, and elevated inflammatory markers; an infection was initially on top of the differential diagnosis.
However, since generalized oedema, cardiac enlargement and pleural effusion on chest radiograph were not consistent with the course of an infection, antibiotics were not started. A computerized tomography scan taken on admission showed enlarged bilateral cervical, axillary and intra-abdominal lymph nodes, mild hepatomegaly and splenomegaly (Fig. ). The clinical course is shown in Fig. . Chest X-ray and computerized tomography images taken on 6th day of hospitalization revealed significantly increased pleural effusion (Fig. ). In addition, the patient gained > 5 kg of body weight, her urine output decreased, and fluid control with diuretics was difficult, so a non-cuffed catheter was inserted through the right femoral vein, and hemodialysis was started. Diuretic-resistant oedema, worsening pleural effusion, and progressive thrombocytopenia were observed, and TAFRO syndrome was suspected at this point. Human herpesvirus 8 and peripheral blood smears were not tested in this case. On the 13th hospital day, biopsies of a left axillary lymph node and bone marrow were performed; no findings compatible with infection and malignancy were observed. As a result, a pulse therapy with 500 mg of methylprednisolone was administered from the 14th day for 3 days, followed by 50 mg of prednisolone daily. Mild fibrosis and megakaryocytosis were present in bone marrow biopsy (Fig. A-B). The lymph node biopsy revealed Castleman-like findings (Fig. C, D), and the patient was diagnosed with TAFRO syndrome according to the diagnostic criteria proposed in 2019 []. After starting prednisolone, although her urine output increased, this was not sufficient, and her platelet count was dependent on platelet transfusions. Considering the effect of these treatments insufficient, we started her on 100 mg of cyclosporine on the 23rd day. A pleural fluid examination was performed on the 33rd day to determine the pleural fluid component, which was a leaky pleural effusion. The dose of cyclosporine was increased to 125 mg on the 43rd day based on therapeutic drug monitoring. The prednisolone dose was reduced by 5 to 10 mg every week or two. The patient was weaned from dialysis on the 34th day of hospitalization because her urine output had stabilized, and her platelet count began to increase on the 51st day. Since the platelet count increased independently of transfusion, a renal biopsy was performed on the 58th day. The renal biopsy results revealed membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) findings consistent with TAFRO syndrome (Fig. ).
Immunofluorescence staining was positive for immunoglobulin (Ig)A and complement 3 and negative for IgG, IgM, and Fibrinogen (Fig. ).
The electron micrograph revealed oedematous enlargement of the subendothelial space. The edematous changes in the mesangial area were observed, although no electron-dense deposits were detected (Fig. ). After renal biopsy, eltrombopag 25 mg, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, was administered to the patient, causing a sustained increase in platelet count, and the patient was discharged on the 108th day.

The patient, unaware she was pregnant, arrived at the emergency department after a fainting episode. She reported acute stabbing pain in the lower abdomen, sweating, dizziness, and vomiting. Blood pressure was 90/60mmHg and heart rate 110/min. Secondary amenorrhea was evaluated at nine weeks and six days, and the urine pregnancy test was positive. Urgent laboratory examination revealed signs of hemodynamic instability with negative markers of inflammation and mild blood coagulation disorder (Table ).
Renal function was normal. A quantitative determination of the beta-chorionic gonadotropin hormone was sent. The gynecological examination showed mild vaginal bleeding and great sensitivity to the movement of the cervix. The abdomen was intensely painful on palpation, with signs of peritoneal irritation. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed the presence of inhomogeneity in the anatomical area of the right adnexal (Figure ), an empty gestational sac in the uterine cavity, free fluid, and multiple blood clots in the pouch of Douglas (Figure ).
Clinical and ultrasound findings and the presence of a positive urine pregnancy test preoperatively established the diagnosis of ruptured ectopic tubal pregnancy. The patient's hemodynamic instability led to the decision for immediate surgical treatment with laparotomy. After opening the abdominal wall, a significant hemoperitoneum was found, and it was deemed necessary to start transfusion with 2 Packed Red Blood Cells and 1 Blood plasma. Intraoperatively, a hemorrhagic rupture of the right ovary was found, without the involvement of the ipsilateral fallopian tube in the damage and the presence of many blood clots in the pelvis (Figure ). The amount of blood and water used to clean the peritoneal cavity in the suction container was 900ml, while the blood clots removed filled a container with dimensions of 15x10x10 cm.
The diagnosis of possible ruptured ectopic ovarian pregnancy was made. The large traumatic surface of the ovary accompanied by hemorrhagic infiltration of the suspensory ligament and the formation of a hematoma at the level of the broad ligament led to the decision to perform salpingo-oophorectomy. Despite the patient's history (the woman was multiparous and had undergone multiple surgical abortions), it was not decided to perform a bilateral salpingectomy because the patient's written and signed consent was not obtained preoperatively. Histological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis (Figures , ).
After a smooth postoperative course, with transfusion of 4 Packed Red Blood Cells and a decreasing value of beta-chorionic gonadotropin hormone, the patient was discharged from our department on the fourth postoperative day. The level of beta-chorionic gonadotropic hormone was on a downward trend; three weeks later, the beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level was zero","[[37.0, 'year']]",F,2022-08-17,heart,"Rupture of Ectopic Ovarian Pregnancy Accompanied by Massive Intra-abdominal Bleeding and Disorder of the Coagulation Mechanism: A Rare and Life-Threatening Obstetric Complication The case report concerns a 37-year-old woman with four cesarean sections in her medical history and a history of multiple surgical abortions.

After opening the abdominal wall, a significant hemoperitoneum was found, and it was deemed necessary to start transfusion with 2 Packed Red Blood Cells and 1 Blood plasma. Intraoperatively, a hemorrhagic rupture of the right ovary was found, without the involvement of the ipsilateral fallopian tube in the damage and the presence of many blood clots in the pelvis (Figure ). The amount of blood and water used to clean the peritoneal cavity in the suction container was 900ml, while the blood clots removed filled a container with dimensions of 15x10x10 cm.
The diagnosis of possible ruptured ectopic ovarian pregnancy was made. The large traumatic surface of the ovary accompanied by hemorrhagic infiltration of the suspensory ligament and the formation of a hematoma at the level of the broad ligament led to the decision to perform salpingo-oophorectomy. Despite the patient's history (the woman was multiparous and had undergone multiple surgical abortions), it was not decided to perform a bilateral salpingectomy because the patient's written and signed consent was not obtained preoperatively. Histological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis (Figures , ).
After a smooth postoperative course, with transfusion of 4 Packed Red Blood Cells and a decreasing value of beta-chorionic gonadotropin hormone, the patient was discharged from our department on the fourth postoperative day. The level of beta-chorionic gonadotropic hormone was on a downward trend; three weeks later, the beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level was zero",rupture ectopic ovarian pregnancy accompany massive intra abdominal bleeding disorder coagulation mechanism rare life threaten obstetric complication case report concern year old woman cesarean section medical history history multiple surgical abortion patient unaware pregnant arrive emergency department faint episode report acute stabbing pain low abdomen sweating dizziness vomit blood pressure heart rate min secondary amenorrhea evaluate week day urine pregnancy test positive urgent laboratory examination reveal sign hemodynamic instability negative marker inflammation mild blood coagulation disorder table renal function normal quantitative determination beta chorionic gonadotropin hormone send gynecological examination show mild vaginal bleeding great sensitivity movement cervix abdomen intensely painful palpation sign peritoneal irritation transvaginal ultrasound reveal presence inhomogeneity anatomical area right adnexal figure gestational sac uterine cavity free fluid multiple blood clot pouch douglas figure clinical ultrasound finding presence positive urine pregnancy test preoperatively establish diagnosis ruptured ectopic tubal pregnancy patient hemodynamic instability lead decision immediate surgical treatment laparotomy open abdominal wall significant hemoperitoneum find deem necessary start transfusion pack red blood cell blood plasma intraoperatively hemorrhagic rupture right ovary find involvement ipsilateral fallopian tube damage presence blood clot pelvis figure blood water clean peritoneal cavity suction container blood clot remove fill container dimension cm diagnosis possible ruptured ectopic ovarian pregnancy large traumatic surface ovary accompany hemorrhagic infiltration suspensory ligament formation hematoma level broad ligament lead decision perform salpingo oophorectomy despite patient history woman multiparous undergo multiple surgical abortion decide perform bilateral salpingectomy patient write sign consent obtain preoperatively histological examination surgical speciman confirm diagnosis figure smooth postoperative course transfusion pack red blood cell decrease value beta chorionic gonadotropin hormone patient discharge department fourth postoperative day level beta chorionic gonadotropic hormone downward trend week later beta human chorionic gonadotropin level zero,0

A difficult intubation was anticipated, and the possibility of achieving surgical airway in an EXIT procedure was planned. The woman, which is known to have a bicornuate uterus, had previously undergone a cesarean section during her first labor due to breech presentation at 39 weeks of gestation. The child was born weighing 2710 g with micrognathia and cleft palate, not requiring an EXIT procedure. She also underwent two spontaneous abortions at 8 weeks of gestation. A prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 32 + 2 weeks of gestation (Figure ) and an ultrasound (US) demonstrated severe micrognathia. Fetal echocardiography and genetic consultation were normal. Amniocentesis was not performed due to maternal refusal. At 35 + 2 weeks of gestation, a two-dimensional US (Figure ) was repeated and a three-dimensional US was performed (Figure ) to evaluate in more detail the fetal anatomy and growth. US showed polyhydramnios, dropped tongue, posterior pharynx, and retrognathia-micrognathia. No palate was observed. While the delivery was planned to 37 weeks of gestation (for fetal lung maturity), at 35 + 3 weeks of gestation, the patient started feeling regular uterine contractions, and it seemed as she was going into spontaneous labor. Contraction stress test was negative, US showed breech presentation, and the blood pressure and pulse were within normal ranges. After a multidisciplinary discussion, the decision was made to deliver through a cesarean section with preparation for a possible EXIT procedure. Members of the team (including fetomaternal medicine/obstetricians, otolaryngologist, neonatologists, anesthesiologist, pediatric anesthesiologist, pediatric pulmonologist, midwifery, and neonatal intensive care unit nursing) were gathered to prepare for the delivery and perform an EXIT procedure to secure an airway if necessary. Due to breech presentation, bicornuate uterus (pregnancy in the left uterus), placental location (fundal posterior), low uterine segment dehiscence, and umbilical cord entanglement around the fetus neck (two complete loops), a classic EXIT procedure could not be performed. The plan was that after the delivery of the breech presentation newborn, the placenta would be left attached supplying oxygen to the newborn. Uterine muscle relaxants will be given to provide maximum time of placental oxygenation to the newborn to allow the otolaryngologist to secure temporary newborn airway. After pulsation will not be felt in the umbilical cord, it would be transected, and later, definitive airway will be established. Through a cesarean section, the baby which was not crying nor breathing spontaneously was delivered and put at a sterile table at the mother's right side with the umbilical cord intact utilizing a modified EXIT procedure. The total maternal blood loss did not exceed 1000 mL, and there were no signs of maternal hemodynamic compromise during the procedure or maternal postoperative decrease in hemoglobin values. A live 2975 g female infant with Apgar scores of 6 and 6 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively, was born (appearance—2, pulse—2, grimace—1, activity—1, respiration—0). Not being able to breathe spontaneously, the baby demonstrated signs of upper airway obstruction. Initially, the team waited for signs of spontaneous breathing before any intervention; however, the neonate did not seem to be able to breathe on her own. Only then, when it was clear that airway support is essential for saving the baby's life, attempts for direct laryngoscopy were undergone. After two failed direct laryngoscopy attempts by the pediatric anesthesiologist, another attempt was made by the otolaryngologist, and since a direct clear vision of the larynx could not be achieved due to the severe micrognathia, a decision to perform a tracheotomy to ventilate and secure the neonate airway was made. A laryngeal mask was inserted, and then, a tracheotomy was performed. Blood gases from the umbilical cord showed pH level of 7.3. Birthweight was 2975 g. The neonate was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit, was ventilated through a 3.0 neonatal Shiley tracheostomy tube, and was stable (Figure ). Cardiac echocardiography, abdominal US, and brain US were normal. The neonate was successfully disconnected from the ventilator 4 days after delivery and started breathing spontaneously (Figure ). Long-term airway management was planned, including distraction osteogenesis to attempt an improvement of airway dynamics, as well as cleft palate repair.

139297,10599098-1,37885529,oa_comm/PMC010xxxxxx/PMC10599098.xml,The Challenges of Spinal Surgery Requiring Ventral Decubitus in the Critical Trauma Patient on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Case Report,"The patient described in this case is a 59-year-old male with a history of chronic alcoholism and no other relevant medical history. He was admitted to the emergency room (ER) of a local secondary hospital after falling from a height of 7 meters onto the pavement. The diagnostic investigation in the ER revealed multiple injuries, namely vertebral trauma with an unstable, complete burst fracture of T5 with posterior bulging into the medullary canal (Figure ) and stable fractures of T1-3; thoracic trauma with pneumothorax, five right costal fractures and three left costal fractures, and multiple pulmonary contusions; abdominal trauma with splenic and hepatic laceration; and pelvic trauma with multiple pelvic fractures.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for continuation of care, under mechanical ventilation, and with an airway secured by an endotracheal tube.
During the five days spent in this ICU, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple, repetitive atelectasis superimposed on a pulmonary infection centered on the areas of pulmonary contusion (Figure ). This led to the development of hypoxemic respiratory failure, that was highly refractory to conventional intervention. Attempting to rotate the patient to ventral decubitus to improve respiratory dynamics was not possible, given the presence of the unstable vertebral fracture. In light of this unfavorable clinical evolution and the lack of alternatives, the decision was made to submit the patient to ECMO rescue after an evaluation from general surgery, noting that the abdominal trauma did not contraindicate the anticoagulation necessary for ECMO. However, the local secondary hospital lacked ECMO capabilities.
The ECMO team of a regional tertiary hospital was contacted and traveled to the local secondary hospital to place the patient on a VV femoro-jugular (VV-FJ) ECMO using the Cardiohelp system (Maquet, Rastatt, Germany). The outflow cannula was inserted in the right femoral vein, and the inflow cannula was inserted in the right jugular vein. The patient was transported, accompanied by the ECMO team, to the ICU of the aforementioned tertiary hospital. Computerized tomography (CT) imaging studies confirmed the position of the cannulae, with the femoral cannula terminating at the confluence of the hepatic veins and the inferior vena cava and the jugular cannula terminating at the confluence of the brachiocephalic and the superior vena cava. The patient was evaluated by general surgery, who determined that the abdominal injuries did not require surgical intervention and did not contra-indicate surgery in ventral decubitus, and by orthopedics, who determined that the vertebral fractures required surgical fixation as soon as the patient’s status permitted.
While in the ICU, the patient was anticoagulated using a non-fractioned heparin (NFH) infusion, monitored with daily activated prothrombin time (aPTT) assays, and under sedoanalgesia with propofol, dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, and rocuronium infusions, with a target of a Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale of -5.
The patient responded poorly to antibiotic therapy, and his respiratory status worsened, making ECMO withdrawal unfeasible. After a multidisciplinary discussion, including the ICU physicians, the clinical perfusion team, the anesthesiology team, the orthopedics team, and the general surgery team, the decision was made to proceed with surgical fixation of the vertebral fractures while the patient was still on ECMO. A contingency plan was established for the surgery, outlining the roles of each team member intraoperatively as well as the steps to be taken in case of intraoperative ECMO dysfunction.
The surgical plan was an internal fixation of the T1-3 and T5 vertebrae via a posterior approach.
The patients’ NFH infusion was suspended for eight hours before surgery. The values of aPTT were 45.3 s before suspension and 36 s in the immediate pre-operative period. Baseline hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL, and the patient had required the transfusion of a total of four units of red blood cell concentrate (RBC) up to this point.
Upon arrival at the operating room (OR), the patient was placed under total intravenous general anesthesia (TIVA) using propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium infusions. The endotracheal tube was replaced with an armored endotracheal tube under direct visualization by video laryngoscopy (C-MAC) and using a Frova endotracheal tube introducer (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA). The patient was monitored according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Standards for Basic Anesthetic Monitoring, as well as invasive blood pressure monitoring via an arterial catheter in the right brachial artery; neuromuscular blockade monitoring with a kinemyiography train-of-four (TOF) device; anesthetic depth monitoring with a processed electroencephalogram monitor (Bispectral Index (BIS) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA); brain oxygenation monitoring with the INVOS (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system; central temperature monitoring with an esophageal probe; and urinary output monitoring via urinary catheter.
Venous access to the patient was assured with a triple-lumen central venous catheter in the right jugular vein, as well as three additional peripheral 16-G venous catheters.
The patient remained under a protective ventilation strategy using the pressure-controlled volume-guaranteed modality, with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg (with a total tidal volume of 420 mL for a predicted body weight of 70,42 kg) and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 mmHg.
The orthopedics, anesthesiology, and clinical perfusion teams were present in the OR throughout the surgery. The patient was rotated en bloc to the ventral decubitus position. The anesthesiologist remained at the head of the patient and was responsible for stabilizing the neck and giving movement commands. The clinical perfusion specialist supervised the rotation and paid special attention to ensuring the integrity of the ECMO cannulae. The remaining team members performed the rotation technique while ensuring alignment of the central bony axis of the patient. Gel cushions were utilized to position the patient while ensuring that the abdomen, axillae, eyes, and nose remained free of pressure and that sensitive pressure points, such as the bony prominences of the hip, knees, ankles, and elbows, were adequately protected and cushioned. Additional cushioning was added to protect the insertion sites of the ECMO cannulae, as per the direction of the clinical perfusion team. In Figure , we can see the patient in the final ventral decubitus position immediately before the start of surgery.
The VV-FJ ECMO was configured with the following settings: blood flow rate 4.12 Lpm; 3200 rpm; sweep rate 2.5 Lpm. The oxygenator was replaced immediately before transport to the OR.
During the surgery, the clinical perfusion specialist alerted the team to an episode of ECMO dysfunction, identified as a sudden decrease in flow rate and revolutions per minute. There was no impact on ΔP or SvO2. In accordance with our contingency plan, this triggered a temporary pause in the surgical procedure to investigate and resolve the issue. The situation was resolved with the repositioning of the gel cushions under the femoral cannula and abdomen, with normal flow being resumed rapidly and with no further dysfunction, namely, without an impact on the patient’s blood pressure or brain oxygenation. This event occurred a total of three times during the surgery.
At the end of the surgery, the patient was rotated back to dorsal decubitus with the same precautions as before. There were no surgical complications.
The surgery lasted 211 minutes. Ventilation was satisfactory, and normocapnia was assured, with a peak inspiratory pressure below 40 cmH2O throughout. The patient required vasopressor support with a noradrenaline infusion at a dose of 0.05 ug/kg/min, maintaining hemodynamic stability with an average mean arterial pressure of 77 mmHg and a mean heart rate of 93 bpm. The patient suffered a total quantifiable fluid loss of 875 mL, divided between urinary losses of 475 mL and hemorrhagic losses of 400 mL, and was administered 2000 mL NaCl 0.9% and 500 mL of RBC for a total positive fluid balance of 1625 mL. Worsening anemia, identified in serial arterial blood gas measurements, required the infusion of two RBCs. Brain oxygenation remained symmetrical and within 20% of the baseline values defined at the start of the surgery. TOF measurements were consistent at 0 responses. Normothermia was assured, with a mean temperature of 36.1 ºC. The mean blood glucose was 104 mg/dL.
During the surgery, 1000 mg of propofol, 50 mg of rocuronium, and 525 ug of fentanyl were administered. There were no surgical complications. A post-operative X-ray shows successful fixation of the fractured vertebrae, as seen in Figure .
The patient returned to the ICU under mechanical ventilation. Given the anticipation of a long period of mechanical ventilation and the convenience of having already suspended NFH, the patient was submitted to a tracheostomy in the immediate post-operative period, replacing the armored endotracheal tube with a 9-mm non-fenestrated tracheal cannula.
NFH was restarted 24 hours postoperatively. The value of aPTT was 38.9 s before the infusion was restarted and returned to therapeutic levels 24 hours later. There were no thromboembolic complications.
ECMO withdrawal was successfully achieved 17 days after the surgery, the cannulae were removed 18 days after the surgery, and ventilatory withdrawal and tracheal decannulation were achieved 36 days after the surgery. Hospital discharge was 50 days after the surgery, with no hemorrhagic complications and no further respiratory complications throughout his inpatient stay, with the patient being transferred to a secondary care facility under the care of orthopedics and physical medicine to begin his rehabilitation.
Six months after discharge, the patient was satisfied with the outcome of his treatment and, while limited, was making significant progress in the recovery of his autonomy with the assistance of a comprehensive rehabilitation program. The patient suffered some neurologic injuries as a result of his spinal trauma, with permanent urologic dysfunction requiring chronic urinary catheterization.","[[59.0, 'year']]",M,2023-09-25,heart,"The Challenges of Spinal Surgery Requiring Ventral Decubitus in the Critical Trauma Patient on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Case Report The patient described in this case is a 59-year-old male with a history of chronic alcoholism and no other relevant medical history. He was admitted to the emergency room (ER) of a local secondary hospital after falling from a height of 7 meters onto the pavement. The diagnostic investigation in the ER revealed multiple injuries, namely vertebral trauma with an unstable, complete burst fracture of T5 with posterior bulging into the medullary canal (Figure ) and stable fractures of T1-3; thoracic trauma with pneumothorax, five right costal fractures and three left costal fractures, and multiple pulmonary contusions; abdominal trauma with splenic and hepatic laceration; and pelvic trauma with multiple pelvic fractures.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for continuation of care, under mechanical ventilation, and with an airway secured by an endotracheal tube.
During the five days spent in this ICU, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple, repetitive atelectasis superimposed on a pulmonary infection centered on the areas of pulmonary contusion (Figure ). This led to the development of hypoxemic respiratory failure, that was highly refractory to conventional intervention. Attempting to rotate the patient to ventral decubitus to improve respiratory dynamics was not possible, given the presence of the unstable vertebral fracture. In light of this unfavorable clinical evolution and the lack of alternatives, the decision was made to submit the patient to ECMO rescue after an evaluation from general surgery, noting that the abdominal trauma did not contraindicate the anticoagulation necessary for ECMO. However, the local secondary hospital lacked ECMO capabilities.
The ECMO team of a regional tertiary hospital was contacted and traveled to the local secondary hospital to place the patient on a VV femoro-jugular (VV-FJ) ECMO using the Cardiohelp system (Maquet, Rastatt, Germany). The outflow cannula was inserted in the right femoral vein, and the inflow cannula was inserted in the right jugular vein. The patient was transported, accompanied by the ECMO team, to the ICU of the aforementioned tertiary hospital. Computerized tomography (CT) imaging studies confirmed the position of the cannulae, with the femoral cannula terminating at the confluence of the hepatic veins and the inferior vena cava and the jugular cannula terminating at the confluence of the brachiocephalic and the superior vena cava. The patient was evaluated by general surgery, who determined that the abdominal injuries did not require surgical intervention and did not contra-indicate surgery in ventral decubitus, and by orthopedics, who determined that the vertebral fractures required surgical fixation as soon as the patient’s status permitted.
While in the ICU, the patient was anticoagulated using a non-fractioned heparin (NFH) infusion, monitored with daily activated prothrombin time (aPTT) assays, and under sedoanalgesia with propofol, dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, and rocuronium infusions, with a target of a Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale of -5.
The patient responded poorly to antibiotic therapy, and his respiratory status worsened, making ECMO withdrawal unfeasible. After a multidisciplinary discussion, including the ICU physicians, the clinical perfusion team, the anesthesiology team, the orthopedics team, and the general surgery team, the decision was made to proceed with surgical fixation of the vertebral fractures while the patient was still on ECMO. A contingency plan was established for the surgery, outlining the roles of each team member intraoperatively as well as the steps to be taken in case of intraoperative ECMO dysfunction.
The surgical plan was an internal fixation of the T1-3 and T5 vertebrae via a posterior approach.
The patients’ NFH infusion was suspended for eight hours before surgery. The values of aPTT were 45.3 s before suspension and 36 s in the immediate pre-operative period. Baseline hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL, and the patient had required the transfusion of a total of four units of red blood cell concentrate (RBC) up to this point.
Upon arrival at the operating room (OR), the patient was placed under total intravenous general anesthesia (TIVA) using propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium infusions. The endotracheal tube was replaced with an armored endotracheal tube under direct visualization by video laryngoscopy (C-MAC) and using a Frova endotracheal tube introducer (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA). The patient was monitored according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Standards for Basic Anesthetic Monitoring, as well as invasive blood pressure monitoring via an arterial catheter in the right brachial artery; neuromuscular blockade monitoring with a kinemyiography train-of-four (TOF) device; anesthetic depth monitoring with a processed electroencephalogram monitor (Bispectral Index (BIS) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA); brain oxygenation monitoring with the INVOS (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system; central temperature monitoring with an esophageal probe; and urinary output monitoring via urinary catheter.
Venous access to the patient was assured with a triple-lumen central venous catheter in the right jugular vein, as well as three additional peripheral 16-G venous catheters.
The patient remained under a protective ventilation strategy using the pressure-controlled volume-guaranteed modality, with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg (with a total tidal volume of 420 mL for a predicted body weight of 70,42 kg) and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 mmHg.
The orthopedics, anesthesiology, and clinical perfusion teams were present in the OR throughout the surgery. The patient was rotated en bloc to the ventral decubitus position. The anesthesiologist remained at the head of the patient and was responsible for stabilizing the neck and giving movement commands. The clinical perfusion specialist supervised the rotation and paid special attention to ensuring the integrity of the ECMO cannulae. The remaining team members performed the rotation technique while ensuring alignment of the central bony axis of the patient. Gel cushions were utilized to position the patient while ensuring that the abdomen, axillae, eyes, and nose remained free of pressure and that sensitive pressure points, such as the bony prominences of the hip, knees, ankles, and elbows, were adequately protected and cushioned. Additional cushioning was added to protect the insertion sites of the ECMO cannulae, as per the direction of the clinical perfusion team. In Figure , we can see the patient in the final ventral decubitus position immediately before the start of surgery.
The VV-FJ ECMO was configured with the following settings: blood flow rate 4.12 Lpm; 3200 rpm; sweep rate 2.5 Lpm. The oxygenator was replaced immediately before transport to the OR.
During the surgery, the clinical perfusion specialist alerted the team to an episode of ECMO dysfunction, identified as a sudden decrease in flow rate and revolutions per minute. There was no impact on ΔP or SvO2. In accordance with our contingency plan, this triggered a temporary pause in the surgical procedure to investigate and resolve the issue. The situation was resolved with the repositioning of the gel cushions under the femoral cannula and abdomen, with normal flow being resumed rapidly and with no further dysfunction, namely, without an impact on the patient’s blood pressure or brain oxygenation. This event occurred a total of three times during the surgery.
At the end of the surgery, the patient was rotated back to dorsal decubitus with the same precautions as before. There were no surgical complications.
The surgery lasted 211 minutes. Ventilation was satisfactory, and normocapnia was assured, with a peak inspiratory pressure below 40 cmH2O throughout. The patient required vasopressor support with a noradrenaline infusion at a dose of 0.05 ug/kg/min, maintaining hemodynamic stability with an average mean arterial pressure of 77 mmHg and a mean heart rate of 93 bpm. The patient suffered a total quantifiable fluid loss of 875 mL, divided between urinary losses of 475 mL and hemorrhagic losses of 400 mL, and was administered 2000 mL NaCl 0.9% and 500 mL of RBC for a total positive fluid balance of 1625 mL. Worsening anemia, identified in serial arterial blood gas measurements, required the infusion of two RBCs. Brain oxygenation remained symmetrical and within 20% of the baseline values defined at the start of the surgery. TOF measurements were consistent at 0 responses. Normothermia was assured, with a mean temperature of 36.1 ºC. The mean blood glucose was 104 mg/dL.
During the surgery, 1000 mg of propofol, 50 mg of rocuronium, and 525 ug of fentanyl were administered. There were no surgical complications. A post-operative X-ray shows successful fixation of the fractured vertebrae, as seen in Figure .
The patient returned to the ICU under mechanical ventilation. Given the anticipation of a long period of mechanical ventilation and the convenience of having already suspended NFH, the patient was submitted to a tracheostomy in the immediate post-operative period, replacing the armored endotracheal tube with a 9-mm non-fenestrated tracheal cannula.
NFH was restarted 24 hours postoperatively. The value of aPTT was 38.9 s before the infusion was restarted and returned to therapeutic levels 24 hours later. There were no thromboembolic complications.
ECMO withdrawal was successfully achieved 17 days after the surgery, the cannulae were removed 18 days after the surgery, and ventilatory withdrawal and tracheal decannulation were achieved 36 days after the surgery. Hospital discharge was 50 days after the surgery, with no hemorrhagic complications and no further respiratory complications throughout his inpatient stay, with the patient being transferred to a secondary care facility under the care of orthopedics and physical medicine to begin his rehabilitation.
Six months after discharge, the patient was satisfied with the outcome of his treatment and, while limited, was making significant progress in the recovery of his autonomy with the assistance of a comprehensive rehabilitation program.

She had a history of factor V Leiden mutation with multiple pulmonary embolisms (PE) and deep venous thrombosis for which she was on long-term warfarin therapy. Her other co-morbidities included hypertension, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, remote subdural hemorrhage and mitral valve replacement.
On examination she was pale, had a blood pressure of 97/52 mm Hg and heart rate of 74. On abdominal examination, she was distended and tender in all four quadrants. Her hemoglobin (Hb) was 4.7 g/dl, white blood cell count was 11.4 × 109/l and platelet count was 146 × 103/mcl. Her international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.5, which was reversed effectively with two units of fresh frozen plasma. She was transfused five units of packed cells improving her hemoglobin from 4.7 to 7.8 g/dl. An emergency contrast CT scan of abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed a large right-sided RSH extending into the space of Retzius (Fig. ).
The following day the patient’s urine output declined progressively and she subsequently developed acute renal failure. A urinary catheter was placed but significant resistance was encountered secondary to her locally distorted anatomy from the hematoma.

His past history was unremarkable, as was his family history. His initial computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography scans showed a 6.8 cm lobulated mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas without invasion of the adjacent vessels and the common bile duct. The tumor showed focal cystic and necrotic areas, and heterogeneous enhancement. Multiple hematogenous metastases were also noted in the liver (). Percutaneous needle biopsy of a hepatic nodule was performed to establish histological diagnosis. Atypical cells with an acinar formation were noted but their histological origin was unknown. Multiple hepatic segmentectomy and pancreatic mass resection were performed to confirm the histological diagnosis. The tumor cells were arranged in trabeculae and solid nests separated by a fibrous or loose fibrovascular stroma. All tumor cells were large and polygonal in shape with abundant, eosinophilic, and finely granular cytoplasm. The final pathologic examination reported well-differentiated (grade 2) pancreatic endocrine tumor and metastasis in the liver. This was supported by the immunohistochemical study that showed the tumor cells were positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, and synaptophysin (). The tumor had 5% Ki-67-positive cells, and the number of mitoses was 1/10 high-power fields. The 24-hr urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels were 10.4 mg/day (normal, < 10 mg/day). The patient had normal levels of serum chromogranin A (37.6 ng/mL; normal, 27-94 ng/mL), parathyroid hormone (51.2 pg/mL; normal, 13-60 pg/mL), and gastrin (74.5 pg/mL; normal, 0-100 pg/mL).
Interferon alpha (6 million IU) was administered subcutaneously three times a week as first-line therapy. Subsequently, a combination etoposide/cisplatin chemotherapy, a somatostatin analog (Sandostatin® LAR, 1 million IU), and gemcitabine monotherapy were administered; these therapies, however, failed to demonstrate tumor shrinkage or stabilization. Therefore, high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation (HIFU) with palliative intent was performed for nodules in segments 6 and 8. However, 2 months after HIFU treatment, the size of the hepatic nodules increased. The disease status rapidly deteriorated, but the patient's general performance was sufficient to allow considering further chemotherapy. We chose sorafenib (800 mg/day, daily) as the salvage treatment. DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumors was used for BRAF mutation analysis. The mutation in exon 15 of the BRAF gene was not found. After 3 weeks of sorafenib treatment and two episodes of grade 3 skin toxicity, the dose was reduced to 600 mg/day. When the skin toxicity resolved to less than grade 1, we increased the dose of sorafenib to 800 mg/day; the skin toxicity did not increase and did not limit the dose. Our patient tolerated sorafenib well. A follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scan after 2 months of sorafenib therapy revealed that the lobulated mass in the uncinate process had become smaller; the maximal diameter was now 5.4 cm (). Post-chemotherapy, a contrast-enhanced CT scan showed that the target liver lesions had a density of 16 Hounsfield units.

His symptoms were associated with blurry vision, nausea, and weakness. Past medical history included diabetes and hypertension. He was a former smoker (quit 4 years ago) and denied travel history or sick contacts.
In the ED, he was noted to be alert, conversant, and oriented. His temperature was 100.8 F, blood pressure was 133/76 mmHg, and heart rate was 104 bpm. Physical examination was unremarkable. The eyes were normal to inspection with normal visual acuity, extra-ocular movements were intact, with no evidence of scleral icterus or conjunctival erythema. Admission labs were notable for a sodium level of 125.2 mEq/L (reference range 135-146 mEq/L) and creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL (reference range 0.7-1.5 mg/dL). The WBC count was 7.6 × 103/μL (reference range 4.8-10.8 × 103/μL). Chest roentgenogram demonstrated no acute infiltrates. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 83. Blood cultures were drawn and the patient was started on intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
On day 1, the patient became slightly confused and disoriented at times. He still complained of blurry vision and was noted to have a fever of 103.4 F. Antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and the antiviral acyclovir was also added.
On day 2, computed tomography of the head showed chronic inflammatory changes with no acute bleed, mass effect, or shift. Lumbar puncture was conducted and revealed colorless cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 4 RBCs/mm3, 29 WBC/mm3 (68% lymphocytes, 31% neutrophils, 1% monocytes), glucose of 115 mg/dL (serum level, 219), and a protein of 195 mg/dL. Bacterial and fungal stains were negative. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the CSF was negative. Serum Lyme antibodies were negative. Blood cultures were negative. Vancomycin was stopped, while ceftriaxone and acyclovir were continued. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of 50-55% with abnormal left ventricular relaxation and a dilated left atrium. The serum sodium level was noted to be 128 mEq/L.
On day 3, the patient was noted to be lethargic and disoriented with a fever of 104.5 F. An electroencephalogram demonstrated abnormal moderate generalized background slowing consistent with diffuse encephalopathy. Antimicrobials were continued.
On day 4, during morning rounds, the patient was his usual self, but continued to be lethargic, yet arousable and responsive to questions, with no new complaints. Ten minutes later, he was found unresponsive and pulseless. The electrocardiogram revealed asystole. As the patient was not on telemetry monitoring nor was a routine electrocardiogram ordered for that morning, there was no other electrocardiogram to compare, besides the admission EKG. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was unsuccessful.
Subsequently, the CSF that had been sent to the Board of Health, was reported to be positive for West Nile Virus (WNV) genome by PCR. IgM antibodies for WNV were also reported positive in the CSF. Serum IgM antibodies for WNV were not carried out. An autopsy was conducted. The central nervous system examination revealed microglial nodules, sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, and focal leptomeningeal monovascular infiltrate consistent with viral meningoencephalitis. West Nile Virus genome was also detected in the brain tissue by PCR. The cardiovascular examination demonstrated focal left ventricular scarring with lymphocytes and histiocytes consistent with myocarditis. West Nile Virus genome was not detected in the myocardium by PCR. The autopsy revealed no evidence for pulmonary embolism or acute myocardial infarction.","[[65.0, 'year']]",M,2009-05-27,heart,"West nile virus myocarditis causing a fatal arrhythmia: a case report A 65-year-old man of Scottish-American descent presented to the emergency department (ED) in late summer 2008 complaining of fever, cough, and decreased oral intake for the past seven days. His symptoms were associated with blurry vision, nausea, and weakness. Past medical history included diabetes and hypertension. He was a former smoker (quit 4 years ago) and denied travel history or sick contacts.
In the ED, he was noted to be alert, conversant, and oriented. His temperature was 100.8 F, blood pressure was 133/76 mmHg, and heart rate was 104 bpm. Physical examination was unremarkable. The eyes were normal to inspection with normal visual acuity, extra-ocular movements were intact, with no evidence of scleral icterus or conjunctival erythema. Admission labs were notable for a sodium level of 125.2 mEq/L (reference range 135-146 mEq/L) and creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL (reference range 0.7-1.5 mg/dL). The WBC count was 7.6 × 103/μL (reference range 4.8-10.8 × 103/μL). Chest roentgenogram demonstrated no acute infiltrates. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 83. Blood cultures were drawn and the patient was started on intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
On day 1, the patient became slightly confused and disoriented at times. He still complained of blurry vision and was noted to have a fever of 103.4 F. Antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and the antiviral acyclovir was also added.

He visited the local hospital 2 days before the admission, and the blood test showed abnormal liver function test and thrombocytopenia. He had no vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. The patient drank 1-2 bottles of alcohol per day. He stopped smoking 30 years ago (10 pack-year history). He had dyspnea at modified medical research (mMRC) grade 1-2. On admission to the hospital, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate was 75/min, respiratory rate was 20/min, and body temperature (tympanic membrane) was 37.3°C. The auscultation of heart sound was regular without murmur. Crackles are noted in both lower lung fields. The patient was conscious. There was no eschar on the skin; however, a lower abdominal popular rash has developed. He had a 1.0 cm right inguinal lymph node, which was movable and non-tender. The physical examination of the abdomen was normal. Laboratory findings revealed white blood cell (WBC) 2,510/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) 13.6 g/dl, platelet 49,000/mm3, Na/K 122/3.6 mEq/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 1.05 mg/dl, aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) 188/88 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1,136 U/L, creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB) 3.4 ng/ml, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 50.1 sec, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.12, and D-dimer 17.06 mg/L. Urinalysis revealed red blood cell (RBC), 10-20/ high-power-field (HPF), and albumin 2+. Stool occult blood was negative. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and right bundle branch block. Chest radiography showed no active lung lesion. However, chest computed tomography (CT) showed peripheral emphysema on both lungs. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes (size 0.7-1.0 cm) on the abdomen CT was observed in the right common iliac area and right inguinal area. Clinical features and blood test showed suspected SFTS.

Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by Vitamin K absence or antagonists (PIVKA)-II were within the normal ranges, and hepatitis B viral antigen and hepatitis C antibody assays were both negative. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass lesion measuring approx. 5 cm in diameter at Segment 4 of the liver, and the mass lesion showed ring enhancement on a dynamic study. As positron emission tomography (PET)-CT showed no significant uptake signals other than the hepatic mass lesion, we ruled out the possibility of a metastatic liver tumor. Under the clinical diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a left lobectomy and regional lymph node dissection were performed.
Grossly, the cut surface of the resected specimen showed an irregular, whitish solid tumor measuring 5.3 × 3.5 cm in maximal diameter. The border between the tumor and normal liver was indistinct, and the tumor directly invaded into the omentum and abdominal wall beyond the serosa of the liver (Fig. a).
Histologically, the tumor showed invasive growth without capsule formation (Fig. b). The background liver tissue showed an almost normal appearance. The tumor cells showed marked nuclear atypia and distinct nucleoli and had eosinophil-rich cytoplasm. Many mitotic Figs. (25/10 high-power field [HPF]), venous invasion, and intrahepatic metastatic lesion were observed. Lymphatic vessel invasion and lymph node metastasis were not apparent. Although overt keratinization was not apparent, nests of squamoid cells showing squamous differentiation were seen (Fig. c). We did not observe goblet-like mucin-producing cells, but a gland-like structure and intracytoplasmic and a small amount of extra-cytoplasmic mucin-producing cells were focally observed (Fig. d). Based on these morphological features, we considered the pathological diagnosis of high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma predominantly composed of an intermediate cell component.
In immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19 but negative for CK8 and hepatocyte paraffin-1. Squamoid cells and intermediate cells were positive for p63, CK14 (Fig. a), CK5/6, and involucrin. Mucin-producing cells were negative for p63 (Fig. b) but highlighted by both alcian blue (Fig. c) and mucicarmine staining. The tumor cells were focally positive for CEA (Fig. d) and CA19–9. Based on these findings, we made the final diagnosis of primary MEC of the liver.
For the analysis of CRTC1/3-MAML2 fusion gene, total RNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue using the miRNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The detection of CRTC1/3-MAML2 fusion was performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the described primers and conditions []. The sequence of the PCR product was confirmed by direct sequencing methods using an ABI Prism 310 sequence analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The RT-PCR products of the patient which electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel showed the presence of CRTC1-MAML2 fusion (Fig. a). CRTC1-MAML2 fusion was confirmed by direct sequencing (Fig. b).
As adjuvant therapy, the oral administration of S-1 (100 mg/day) was started. Two years after the patient’s surgery, para-aortic lymph node swelling was detected by abdominal CT although serum tumor markers (CEA and CA19–9) were within normal ranges. Under the clinical diagnosis of suspected lymph node recurrence, radiation therapy (total 60 Gy) combined with S-1 therapy (100 mg/day) was performed for 13 months. No further therapy was performed. At the time of this writing, almost 10 years after the surgery, the patient is alive with no evidence of tumor recurrence.","[[79.0, 'year']]",F,2019-07-27,liver,"Primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the liver with CRTC1-MAML2 fusion: a case report A 79-year-old Japanese female visited our hospital in complaining of right hypochondrium pain. She had no remarkable medical or family history. Laboratory tests on admission showed no abnormality except for elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) at 146 ng/mL (normal value, < 5.0) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) at 415 U/mL (normal value, < 37). Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by Vitamin K absence or antagonists (PIVKA)-II were within the normal ranges, and hepatitis B viral antigen and hepatitis C antibody assays were both negative. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass lesion measuring approx. 5 cm in diameter at Segment 4 of the liver, and the mass lesion showed ring enhancement on a dynamic study.

216343,7666987-1,33204169,oa_noncomm/PMC007xxxxxx/PMC7666987.xml,Distal Extension Denture – Case Report and Overview,"A 65-year-old man presented with complaints of difficulty in chewing, recurrent pain from various regions of the mouth, and poor dental aesthetics. The medical history was clear. No abnormality was detected upon extra-oral examination.
A thorough intra-oral examination and radiographic examination yielded the following findings: only the anterior teeth were in occlusion, and the occlusal vertical dimension was reduced (). The mandibular anterior teeth showed signs of severe incisal and labial wear (). Multiple carious teeth, retained roots, over-contoured and splinted metal-ceramic crowns, and multiple missing teeth were found on the maxillary arch (). Meanwhile, multiple missing teeth and teeth with severe wear were found on the mandibular arch (). A radiographic examination confirmed multiple caries on the teeth of both arches, as well as periodontal disease with generalized moderate-to-severe horizontal bone loss (). Apical radiolucencies were observed on the retained roots of the maxillary arch and on the anterior teeth of the mandibular arch.
The findings were explained to the patient, and a treatment plan was formulated after a thorough discussion. Scaling was provided, and oral hygiene instructions were given. The carious lesion on the right mandibular first molar was stabilized, and the carious lesion on the right mandibular second premolar was restored with disto-occlusal amalgam. Due to the poor prognosis of the maxillary teeth, maxillary clearance was then performed, and an immediate complete maxillary denture was provided. The right mandibular first molar required root canal treatment and was referred to a specialist for management. However, an appointment could be made only 11 months later. It was decided to first construct an immediate maxillary complete denture to improve the patient’s dental aesthetics and to address the patient’s chewing problems as he awaited specialist endodontic care. The provision of a maxillary complete denture could improve the aesthetics/mastication and prevent excessive wear of the remaining teeth even without a mandibular removable partial denture.
Shortly after delivery of the immediate maxillary complete denture, the mandibular incisors were extracted due to severity of the bone loss around these teeth and the presence of apical pathologies. These teeth were kept until the maxillary complete denture was delivered; otherwise, only the right canines would have been in occlusion.
The right mandibular first molar was endodontically treated. A mandibular removable partial denture was planned. Maxillary and mandibular study impressions were taken after wound healing was observed a few months following the extractions of the mandibular incisors. The lower cast was surveyed, and a partial denture was designed. In view of the amount of non-carious tooth substance loss on the occlusal and buccal aspects of the left mandibular first premolar, a metal-ceramic crown was planned for the tooth. A metal-ceramic crown was also planned for the endodontically treated right mandibular first molar. The ideal locations and contours for the rest seats, reciprocal planes and undercut areas were incorporated into the crowns ().
After the crowns were cemented and the necessary mouth preparation was performed, a lower working impression was taken. Next, the cobalt-chromium framework was fabricated for denture framework try-in. The fit of the framework was considered to be satisfactory (). The framework was returned to the laboratory for the addition of a close-fitting self-cured acrylic resin tray to the free-end saddle area. The tray area was added after try-in because an accurate observation of the fit of the framework could be made without the tray. In addition, if the framework failed to seat properly, the operator would not have to wonder whether the interference came from the framework or the tray.
The tray should have a full extension similar to that of a complete denture in the corresponding region (). This means that the tray should cover the retromolar pad distally and the external oblique ridge buccally. The flange of the tray should extend lingually to the full functional depth of the lingual sulcus (see below). After the framework was tried with the tray attached to it in the mouth, the tray was cleaned and dried. Zinc oxide eugenol impression paste (Kelly’s paste, Waterpik Inc., Collins, CO, USA) was applied, and the framework was seated in the mouth. Meanwhile, the patient was instructed to protrude his tongue to record the lingual sulcus with the mylohyoid muscle contracted. This could prevent the denture from displacement due to the movement of the muscle during its function (). The minimal space between the fitting surface of the tray and the mucosa, together with the viscosity of the zinc oxide eugenol, means that pressure was exerted to the mucosa to displace it. This will help to increase the load that the mucosa shares, and it will minimize the downward movement of the saddle (see later discussion). It is important that the tray does not show through the impression material (). Next, the saddle area was removed from the master cast. The framework was seated and sealed in position. Dental stone (Type III gypsum) was poured to form the saddle area in the altered master cast.
Because the remaining opposing teeth did not indicate a well-defined intercuspal position, a wax rim was constructed. An interocclusal record and a facebow record were taken so that the maxillary cast could be properly mounted. Meanwhile, the mandibular cast could be mounted in the determined intercuspal position. Also, the size, mould and shade of the denture teeth to be used were determined.
Next, wax try-in was performed. The patient was satisfied with the appearance. The denture was then processed and finished. At the delivery appointment, the jaw position and occlusion were verified. Detailed denture maintenance instructions were provided. The patient was very satisfied with the result ( and ). The patient then attended a yearly review for 10 years till the present. During the follow-up period, denture clasps were adjusted to improve retention. No other denture adjustment, such as relining, was necessary. At 10 years after denture delivery, no significant resorption of residual ridge corresponding to the free-end saddle area was observed (). However, signs of the attrition of the artificial teeth were noticed ().","[[65.0, 'year']]",M,2020-11-10,liver,"Distal Extension Denture – Case Report and Overview A 65-year-old man presented with complaints of difficulty in chewing, recurrent pain from various regions of the mouth, and poor dental aesthetics.

The patient first had abdominal pain two weeks prior, which he described as diffuse, worse in the substernal/epigastric region, and on the right upper side of the abdomen. The pain did not radiate and was persistent, with a severity of 3/10. At that time, the patient thought he had ""gas."" The pain was not relieved with over-the-counter antacids. He did not have changes to his bowel movement. He denied nausea and vomiting. The day prior to admission, the pain worsened to eight out of 10 and he felt subjectively feverish. This ultimately prompted the patient to go to the emergency department, where he was subsequently admitted to the hospital.
The patient denied illicit drug or alcohol use. He was a former smoker with a 10-pack-year history and quit four years prior. One week before admission, he went on a road trip by car that was around eight hours long. He denied a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. He had no family history of clotting and no family history of cancer. He did not have a history of gallstones.
His medical history was significant for diabetes, for which he was taking metformin 1,000 mg two times a day, dulaglutide 3 mg/0.5 mL every seven days for about two years, dapagliflozin 10 mg tablet once daily, insulin aspart 12 units three times a day before meals, and insulin glargine 44 units under the skin once daily. He had had good diabetes control with glycated hemoglobin (Hba1c) <7% for the past few years. Three months before admission, the patient's dulaglutide was increased from 1.5 mg every seven days to 3 mg every seven days to help weight loss and reduce insulin requirements.
Of note, he was also on allopurinol 200 mg once daily for his gout and atorvastatin 40 mg once daily for hyperlipidemia. He was on amlodipine 10 mg once daily, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, and metoprolol tartrate 50 mg two times a day for his hypertension. He also had been taking pantoprazole 40 mg once daily for gastrointestinal reflux disease. He had a medical history of achalasia, a status post Heller myotomy that was complicated by an esophageal perforation and repaired with Dor fundoplication a few months prior.
In the hospital, the patient was afebrile and had stable vital signs. On physical examination, the patient had abdominal tenderness in the right upper quadrant. There were no noted rashes. No peripheral edema was noted. No rebound tenderness was noted. All other parts of the physical exam were unremarkable.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was done, which showed findings suspicious for focal occlusive thrombosis involving the proximal jejunal vein (the proximal branch of the superior mesenteric vein). A hazy inflammatory stranding was noted around the pancreatic uncinate process, which raised concern for focal acute pancreatitis or infiltrative pancreatic neoplasm (Figure ).
The portal and splenic veins were grossly patent and unremarkable. No gallstones were noted.
A mesenteric duplex was done, which showed >70% stenosis at the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. The superior mesenteric artery appeared aneurysmal/ectatic and measured 1.13 cm at its largest diameter.
Lipase was noted to be marginally elevated at 101 u/L (normal range: 11-82 u/L). The white blood cell (WBC) count was also marginally elevated at 10.50 thousand/uL. Lactic acid was normal at 0.6 mmol/L. The basic metabolic panel (BMP) was unremarkable. Creatinine was at 1.6 mg/dl (the baseline was 1.8-1.9). A coagulation panel was ordered due to the superior mesenteric vein thrombosis found on the CT scan. Prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were normal. Protein S and protein C were also within normal levels. Antithrombin 3 activity was slightly decreased at 89% (compared to normal at 92%-136%). In the emergency room, the patient was given 1 liter of normal saline bolus, and he was maintained at 100 mL/hr while admitted.
The gastroenterology and vascular surgery consulting teams were consulted. The patient was started on a heparin drip. The vascular consulting team advised continuing anticoagulation for six months and recommended no surgical intervention. A GI-recommended endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), which showed a 4.5-centimeter fullness in the head of the pancreas, was isoechoic compared to the rest of the pancreas (Figure ).
The pancreatic duct tapered smoothly towards the ampulla. Fine needle aspiration was performed using a 22- and 25-gauge needle. Reactive lymph nodes were seen in the peripancreatic region. The remainder of the pancreas body and tail appeared normal. A normal left lobe of the liver was noted. The normal celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and portal triad were noted. The biopsy results showed atypical pancreatic acinar cells with mild cytologic atypia, which favors reactive changes. Neutrophils, histiocytes, and lymphocytes were noted in the pathology report. Necrotic debris was also noted in the pathology report.
After the endoscopic ultrasound and biopsies, his pancreatitis worsened. His serum lipase further increased to 3,499 u/L at that time. He was treated with fluids and pain management. After a few more days, the patient showed improvement, and he was sent home with apixaban to complete for six months. After a discussion with his endocrinologist, he was advised to discontinue dulaglutide after discharge. Follow-up was arranged with GI and vascular services after discharge. Due to the mass noted on the uncinate process of the pancreas, the patient was advised to have a repeat CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis six weeks after discharge, which showed an ill-defined hypovascular area corresponding with the sequela of acute pancreatitis.","[[57.0, 'year']]",M,2023-12-06,heart,"An Atypical Presentation of Dulaglutide-Induced Pancreatitis Complicated by Superior Mesenteric Vein Thrombosis This case report presents a 57-year-old male of Southeast Asian descent admitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain.

The gastroenterology and vascular surgery consulting teams were consulted. The patient was started on a heparin drip. The vascular consulting team advised continuing anticoagulation for six months and recommended no surgical intervention. A GI-recommended endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), which showed a 4.5-centimeter fullness in the head of the pancreas, was isoechoic compared to the rest of the pancreas (Figure ).
The pancreatic duct tapered smoothly towards the ampulla. Fine needle aspiration was performed using a 22- and 25-gauge needle. Reactive lymph nodes were seen in the peripancreatic region. The remainder of the pancreas body and tail appeared normal. A normal left lobe of the liver was noted. The normal celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and portal triad were noted. The biopsy results showed atypical pancreatic acinar cells with mild cytologic atypia, which favors reactive changes. Neutrophils, histiocytes, and lymphocytes were noted in the pathology report. Necrotic debris was also noted in the pathology report.
After the endoscopic ultrasound and biopsies, his pancreatitis worsened. His serum lipase further increased to 3,499 u/L at that time. He was treated with fluids and pain management. After a few more days, the patient showed improvement, and he was sent home with apixaban to complete for six months. After a discussion with his endocrinologist, he was advised to discontinue dulaglutide after discharge. Follow-up was arranged with GI and vascular services after discharge. Due to the mass noted on the uncinate process of the pancreas, the patient was advised to have a repeat CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis six weeks after discharge, which showed an ill-defined hypovascular area corresponding with the sequela of acute pancreatitis.",atypical presentation dulaglutide induce pancreatitis complicate superior mesenteric vein thrombosis case report present year old male southeast asian descent admit hospital abdominal pain patient abdominal pain week prior describe diffuse bad substernal epigastric region right upper abdomen pain radiate persistent severity time patient think gas pain relieve counter antacid change bowel movement deny nausea vomiting day prior admission pain worsen feel subjectively feverish ultimately prompt patient emergency department subsequently admit hospital patient deny illicit drug alcohol use smoker pack year history quit year prior week admission go road trip car hour long deny history deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism family history clotting family history cancer history gallstone medical history significant diabetes take metformin mg time day dulaglutide ml seven day year dapagliflozin mg tablet daily insulin aspart unit time day meal insulin glargine unit skin daily good diabete control glycate hemoglobin past year month admission patient dulaglutide increase mg seven day mg seven day help weight loss reduce insulin requirement note allopurinol mg daily gout atorvastatin mg daily hyperlipidemia amlodipine mg daily lisinopril mg daily metoprolol tartrate mg time day hypertension take pantoprazole mg daily gastrointestinal reflux disease medical history achalasia status post heller myotomy complicate esophageal perforation repair dor fundoplication month prior hospital patient afebrile stable vital sign physical examination patient abdominal tenderness right upper quadrant note rash peripheral edema note rebound tenderness note part physical exam unremarkable ct scan abdomen pelvis contrast show finding suspicious focal occlusive thrombosis involve proximal jejunal vein proximal branch superior mesenteric vein hazy inflammatory stranding note pancreatic uncinate process raise concern focal acute pancreatitis infiltrative pancreatic neoplasm figure portal splenic vein grossly patent unremarkable gallstone note mesenteric duplex show stenosis origin superior mesenteric artery superior mesenteric artery appear aneurysmal ectatic measure cm large diameter lipase note marginally elevate u l normal range u l white blood cell wbc count marginally elevated thousand ul lactic acid normal mmol basic metabolic panel bmp unremarkable creatinine mg dl baseline coagulation panel order superior mesenteric vein thrombosis find ct scan prothrombin time pt international normalize ratio inr partial thromboplastin time ptt normal protein s protein c normal level antithrombin activity slightly decrease compare normal emergency room patient give liter normal saline bolus maintain ml hr admit gastroenterology vascular surgery consulting team consult patient start heparin drip vascular consulting team advise continue anticoagulation month recommend surgical intervention gi recommend endoscopic ultrasound eus show centimeter fullness head pancrea isoechoic compare rest pancrea figure pancreatic duct taper smoothly ampulla fine needle aspiration perform gauge needle reactive lymph node see peripancreatic region remainder pancreas body tail appear normal normal left lobe liver note normal celiac artery superior mesenteric artery portal triad note biopsy result show atypical pancreatic acinar cell mild cytologic atypia favor reactive change neutrophil histiocyte lymphocyte note pathology report necrotic debris note pathology report endoscopic ultrasound biopsy pancreatitis worsen serum lipase increase u l time treat fluid pain management day patient show improvement send home apixaban complete month discussion endocrinologist advise discontinue dulaglutide discharge follow arrange gi vascular service discharge mass note uncinate process pancrea patient advise repeat ct angiogram abdomen pelvis week discharge show ill define hypovascular area correspond sequela acute pancreatitis,0

She therefore underwent a cone biopsy of the cervix with loop electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP), which revealed ABC associated with microinvasive SCC with the tumors presented at endocervical margin. The remaining cervix was too small to do a repeat cone biopsy, so a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was proposed to find out an occult malignancy.

There is no evidence of distant metastasis or any suggestive metastatic lymph node by a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). Clinically stage IB was suggested and following radical hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection was undertaken uneventfully (Figure ).

The patient had experienced chronic otitis of the left ear from infancy and underwent surgery for cholesteatoma in the tympanum at another hospital. However, his clinical symptoms had persisted. His conscious hearing was poor, and he suffered from earache, ear boredom, headache and dizziness.
The patient had no significant past medical history.
The patient’s family history was unremarkable.
Otoscopic examination demonstrated a large amount of pus in the left external auditory canal, a fleshy polyp present at a deeper site, and mucosal edema in the previously operated area (Figure ). Audiometric assessment confirmed a severe conductive hearing loss; hearing threshold was 80 dB and auditory brainstem response was 70 dB on the affected side. Nasopharyngoscopy showed that the orifice of the left ET opened well.
The laboratory examination was otherwise unremarkable. The laboratory assessment included routine blood tests. Tests for C-reactive proteins and viral hepatitis markers were negative. Glucose and serum insulin levels were normal.
The unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone showed some changes, including a well-circumscribed, mixed density tumor with a fat density area in the ET; the lesion extended down to the left part of the tympanum and external auditory canal (Figure ), without ossicular chain, which had resulted from the mastoidectomy. The T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the transverse plane showed a 3.2 cm × 1.3 cm × 2.0 cm, well-defined, homogeneous lesion with high signal intensity along the left ET. The mass showed signal intensity similar to that of the fat on all sequences and with little cartilage signal (Figure ). The lesion extended down to the left part of the tympanum and external auditory canal, where the signal was slightly higher than the part in the ET. On fat-saturated T1- and T2-weighted sequences, the part of the mass in the ET demonstrated a decreased signal intensity, indicating that the mass was consistent with macroscopic fat. The mass was surrounded by a smooth, thick, hypointense capsule, which was enhanced slightly after contrast administration.
The ET diameter was expanded, to about 0.8 cm. The part of the mass in the tympanum and external auditory canal was classified as a fleshy polyp. However, “hairs” were visible on the surface of the mass and cartilage surrounded by the mass could be seen in the ET area (Figure ). The mass, in which the anterior lower part and posterior upper part were connected by a thin membranaceous tissue, was in the ET. It was tightly bonded to the former ET wall and could not be removed in toto, so serial partial excision was performed. The resulting cavity (composed of the tympanum and external auditory canal) was then resolved by filling with abdominal fat.
On gross examination, the resected mass appeared as a cluster of irregular, soft, grey-colored tissue. Microscopically, a photomicrograph of the mass revealed characteristics of keratinized squamous epithelium, adipose, sweat gland and mature skeletal muscle tissues.

95807,8684064-1,34920754,oa_comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8684064.xml,Subcapsular hepatic hematoma as a complication of severe preeclampsia: a case report,"A 40-year-old gravida 1 para 0 Caucasian woman presented at 39 + 6 weeks gestational age with a 3-day history of new onset pain in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy. At 39 + 1 weeks gestation she had started outpatient cervical ripening with dinoprostone (Cervidil) because of her advanced maternal age. She described the pain along her right torso as severe, shooting, and sharp, but at times pleuritic in nature. It rapidly progressed from her right trapezius to encompass the entirety of her right torso, from her upper abdominal quadrant and epigastrium, radiating to her back, chest, shoulder, and neck. Her pain was initially attributed to possible radiculopathy, as she had a previous history of the same. Her vital signs at initial presentation were normal, with no hypertension noted, and there were no concerns regarding the fetal status. No further investigations were ordered and a full neurological examination was not documented.
She represented less than 24 hours later at 40 + 0 weeks gestational age, and was found to be hypertensive at 157/101 and 164/112 mmHg. Oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. She had sinus tachycardia on arrival, ranging from 110 to 140 bpm and persisting throughout the peripartum period. She was tender in the right upper quadrant, however there were no peritoneal signs, and no hepatomegaly was appreciated in the presence of the gravid uterus. She was tender from the right side of her neck through to her right lower back. Her reflexes were 3 + bilaterally with no clonus. The fetal heart rate was normal. Her blood investigations revealed a hemoglobin of 105 g/L, platelets 156,000 g/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 193 μ/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 111 μ/L, and uric acid 429 μmol/L. White blood cell count, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and coagulation profile were within the normal range. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with no abnormal features, apart from the previously noted tachycardia.
After diagnosing preeclampsia, induction of labor was started, as was an infusion of magnesium sulfate. Due to the unusual but significant pain that she was experiencing, a range of differential diagnoses were considered by the obstetrical and anesthesia team. Preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome was the working diagnosis, however differential diagnoses included fatty liver, radiculopathy, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and pyelonephritis. The patient requested labor analgesia be initiated and a combined spinal epidural was placed when the patient’s cervix was 2 cm dilated. Analgesia was maintained via programmed intermittent epidural bolus with patient-controlled epidural analgesia as needed, in keeping with our institutional practice. The patient reported satisfactory analgesia with regard to her labor pain, but still complained of severe pain in her right torso that was unresponsive to acetaminophen and opioids. Blood investigations monitored every 4 hours remained stable with hemoglobin of 103–102 g/L, platelets 158,000–165,000 g/L, ALT 176–169 μ/L, AST 100–97 μ/L, and uric acid 400–420 μmol/L. The LDH, creatinine, and coagulation profile remained normal. Labor progressed to full dilation with oxytocin augmentation, but as a result of torso pain she was unable to exert adequate effort with pushing. Ultimately, the obstetrical team consented the patient for a trial of forceps and possible cesarean delivery.
In the operating room, the obstetrics team performed an examination under anesthesia, which revealed the fetus to be in an occiput-transverse position at station zero, and the decision was made to proceed to cesarean delivery as the station was too high to perform a trial of forceps. A nonvigorous male infant was delivered with Apgar scores of 3 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Placental delivery was uneventful. Atonic postpartum hemorrhage was treated with a bolus of 2 units IV oxytocin and carboprost 250 mcg intramuscular (IM), in addition to an oxytocin infusion. As per our institutional practice, a bolus of oxytocin is only used when the patient has multiple risk factors for intraoperative hemorrhage or is experiencing uterine atony. This low dose was chosen to prevent potential side effects (nausea, vomiting, chest pain) and complications (hypotension, hypertension, ST segment changes, myocardial ischemia, bronchospasm) that can be associated with higher dose boluses when given at the time of cesarean section [, ]. Prior to fascial closure, the obstetrics team manually explored the abdomen to the extent possible through the Pfannenstiel incision. No gross abnormalities were identified. The patient’s right torso pain persisted throughout her time in the operating room, with only a slight improvement after surgical anesthesia obtained via the epidural. After delivery, 2.5 mg of epidural morphine was given for postoperative analgesia. The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout the operation, although remained tachycardic. Estimated blood loss was approximately 900 mL. Postoperatively, the patient was sent for a computed tomography (CT) scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis, including contrast for a pulmonary embolism protocol to investigate the abdominal pain and persistent tachycardia. No pulmonary embolus was found and a small right pleural effusion with subsegmental atelectasis was noted. However, the most impressive feature on the scan was a large but intact subcapsular liver hematoma that measured approximately 16 × 7 × 14 cm (Fig. ). Portal hypertension was suggested by the presence of portosystemic varices. The general surgery team was consulted and recommended conservative management with strict blood pressure control requiring oral labetalol, frequent complete blood count (CBC) monitoring, and 48 hours of bedrest. If, however, the SCH had been diagnosed antepartum, labor would have been avoided and delivery would have been expedited via immediate cesarean section. The SCH is at risk of rupture with active pushing, convulsions, or abdominal trauma, including vigorous palpation of the right upper quadrant []. In this case, prophylactic antibiotics were not used as there were no signs of infection and the underlying etiology was noninfectious. Interventional radiology was on standby to perform hepatic artery embolization if the SCH significantly increased in size or there was concern about imminent rupture. Serial monitoring of blood work revealed a hemoglobin of 70 g/L and 56 g/L on postoperative days 1 and 2, respectively, prompting transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells on day 2. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 5 with her hemoglobin stable at 85 g/L.
An early postoperative follow-up visit was arranged 15 days postpartum and at that visit the patient was noted to be pale, tachypneic, and upon questioning she stated increasing shortness of breath and a persistence of her pleuritic chest pain. She was sent back to the IWK Health Centre where her vital signs were as follows: heart rate 110–130 bpm, blood pressure 112/66 mmHg, oxygen saturation 97% on room air, respiratory rate 40–48, temperature 37.9 °C. Blood investigations revealed a white cell count of 6, hemoglobin 97 g/L, platelets 650,000 g/L, ALT 75 μ/L, AST 88 μ/L, LDH 1310 μ/L, and coagulation profile remained normal. A repeat abdominal CT scan reported an increase in the size of the liver hematoma to 14 × 8.5 × 18.3 cm (Fig. ). Although there was no evidence of active intralesional bleeding or rupture, the liver capsule was difficult to visualize in the superior aspect, and could suggest significant thinning and imminent rupture. The CT scan of the chest reported a large right pleural effusion with mediastinal shift (Fig. ).
The patient was urgently transferred from the stand-alone maternity hospital to a nearby hospital under the care of the thoracic surgery team, with the general surgery team on standby. A chest tube was placed, but ultimately the patient required video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), with right partial decortication of an infected, loculated pleural effusion prior to her discharge home. The pleural effusion aspirate showed no growth. The right pleural effusion was felt to be exudative in nature and secondary to the adjacent large SCH. Throughout the admission she remained normotensive and her hepatic hematoma remained stable with no signs of active bleeding. She was discharged home on day 2 following the VATS procedure, coinciding with day 21 following her cesarean section. At discharge, her hemoglobin was 74 g/L and her platelets were 884,000 g/L.
She continued to receive follow-up with general surgery and obstetrics as an outpatient. A CT performed 4 weeks postpartum showed the hepatic hematoma had decreased in size to 12.6 × 6.4 × 15.1 cm and at 6 months postpartum had decreased to 3.8 × 2.2 × 3.1 cm and did not require any further follow-up.","[[40.0, 'year']]",F,2021-12-17,heart,"Subcapsular hepatic hematoma as a complication of severe preeclampsia: a case report A 40-year-old gravida 1 para 0 Caucasian woman presented at 39 + 6 weeks gestational age with a 3-day history of new onset pain in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy.

It rapidly progressed from her right trapezius to encompass the entirety of her right torso, from her upper abdominal quadrant and epigastrium, radiating to her back, chest, shoulder, and neck. Her pain was initially attributed to possible radiculopathy, as she had a previous history of the same. Her vital signs at initial presentation were normal, with no hypertension noted, and there were no concerns regarding the fetal status. No further investigations were ordered and a full neurological examination was not documented.
She represented less than 24 hours later at 40 + 0 weeks gestational age, and was found to be hypertensive at 157/101 and 164/112 mmHg. Oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. She had sinus tachycardia on arrival, ranging from 110 to 140 bpm and persisting throughout the peripartum period. She was tender in the right upper quadrant, however there were no peritoneal signs, and no hepatomegaly was appreciated in the presence of the gravid uterus. She was tender from the right side of her neck through to her right lower back. Her reflexes were 3 + bilaterally with no clonus. The fetal heart rate was normal. Her blood investigations revealed a hemoglobin of 105 g/L, platelets 156,000 g/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 193 μ/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 111 μ/L, and uric acid 429 μmol/L. White blood cell count, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and coagulation profile were within the normal range. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with no abnormal features, apart from the previously noted tachycardia.
After diagnosing preeclampsia, induction of labor was started, as was an infusion of magnesium sulfate. Due to the unusual but significant pain that she was experiencing, a range of differential diagnoses were considered by the obstetrical and anesthesia team. Preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome was the working diagnosis, however differential diagnoses included fatty liver, radiculopathy, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and pyelonephritis. The patient requested labor analgesia be initiated and a combined spinal epidural was placed when the patient’s cervix was 2 cm dilated. Analgesia was maintained via programmed intermittent epidural bolus with patient-controlled epidural analgesia as needed, in keeping with our institutional practice. The patient reported satisfactory analgesia with regard to her labor pain, but still complained of severe pain in her right torso that was unresponsive to acetaminophen and opioids. Blood investigations monitored every 4 hours remained stable with hemoglobin of 103–102 g/L, platelets 158,000–165,000 g/L, ALT 176–169 μ/L, AST 100–97 μ/L, and uric acid 400–420 μmol/L. The LDH, creatinine, and coagulation profile remained normal. Labor progressed to full dilation with oxytocin augmentation, but as a result of torso pain she was unable to exert adequate effort with pushing. Ultimately, the obstetrical team consented the patient for a trial of forceps and possible cesarean delivery.
In the operating room, the obstetrics team performed an examination under anesthesia, which revealed the fetus to be in an occiput-transverse position at station zero, and the decision was made to proceed to cesarean delivery as the station was too high to perform a trial of forceps. A nonvigorous male infant was delivered with Apgar scores of 3 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Placental delivery was uneventful. Atonic postpartum hemorrhage was treated with a bolus of 2 units IV oxytocin and carboprost 250 mcg intramuscular (IM), in addition to an oxytocin infusion. As per our institutional practice, a bolus of oxytocin is only used when the patient has multiple risk factors for intraoperative hemorrhage or is experiencing uterine atony. This low dose was chosen to prevent potential side effects (nausea, vomiting, chest pain) and complications (hypotension, hypertension, ST segment changes, myocardial ischemia, bronchospasm) that can be associated with higher dose boluses when given at the time of cesarean section [, ]. Prior to fascial closure, the obstetrics team manually explored the abdomen to the extent possible through the Pfannenstiel incision. No gross abnormalities were identified. The patient’s right torso pain persisted throughout her time in the operating room, with only a slight improvement after surgical anesthesia obtained via the epidural. After delivery, 2.5 mg of epidural morphine was given for postoperative analgesia. The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout the operation, although remained tachycardic. Estimated blood loss was approximately 900 mL. Postoperatively, the patient was sent for a computed tomography (CT) scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis, including contrast for a pulmonary embolism protocol to investigate the abdominal pain and persistent tachycardia. No pulmonary embolus was found and a small right pleural effusion with subsegmental atelectasis was noted. However, the most impressive feature on the scan was a large but intact subcapsular liver hematoma that measured approximately 16 × 7 × 14 cm (Fig. ). Portal hypertension was suggested by the presence of portosystemic varices. The general surgery team was consulted and recommended conservative management with strict blood pressure control requiring oral labetalol, frequent complete blood count (CBC) monitoring, and 48 hours of bedrest. If, however, the SCH had been diagnosed antepartum, labor would have been avoided and delivery would have been expedited via immediate cesarean section. The SCH is at risk of rupture with active pushing, convulsions, or abdominal trauma, including vigorous palpation of the right upper quadrant []. In this case, prophylactic antibiotics were not used as there were no signs of infection and the underlying etiology was noninfectious. Interventional radiology was on standby to perform hepatic artery embolization if the SCH significantly increased in size or there was concern about imminent rupture. Serial monitoring of blood work revealed a hemoglobin of 70 g/L and 56 g/L on postoperative days 1 and 2, respectively, prompting transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells on day 2. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 5 with her hemoglobin stable at 85 g/L.
An early postoperative follow-up visit was arranged 15 days postpartum and at that visit the patient was noted to be pale, tachypneic, and upon questioning she stated increasing shortness of breath and a persistence of her pleuritic chest pain. She was sent back to the IWK Health Centre where her vital signs were as follows: heart rate 110–130 bpm, blood pressure 112/66 mmHg, oxygen saturation 97% on room air, respiratory rate 40–48, temperature 37.9 °C. Blood investigations revealed a white cell count of 6, hemoglobin 97 g/L, platelets 650,000 g/L, ALT 75 μ/L, AST 88 μ/L, LDH 1310 μ/L, and coagulation profile remained normal. A repeat abdominal CT scan reported an increase in the size of the liver hematoma to 14 × 8.5 × 18.3 cm (Fig. ). Although there was no evidence of active intralesional bleeding or rupture, the liver capsule was difficult to visualize in the superior aspect, and could suggest significant thinning and imminent rupture. The CT scan of the chest reported a large right pleural effusion with mediastinal shift (Fig. ).
The patient was urgently transferred from the stand-alone maternity hospital to a nearby hospital under the care of the thoracic surgery team, with the general surgery team on standby. A chest tube was placed, but ultimately the patient required video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), with right partial decortication of an infected, loculated pleural effusion prior to her discharge home. The pleural effusion aspirate showed no growth. The right pleural effusion was felt to be exudative in nature and secondary to the adjacent large SCH. Throughout the admission she remained normotensive and her hepatic hematoma remained stable with no signs of active bleeding. She was discharged home on day 2 following the VATS procedure, coinciding with day 21 following her cesarean section. At discharge, her hemoglobin was 74 g/L and her platelets were 884,000 g/L.
She continued to receive follow-up with general surgery and obstetrics as an outpatient. A CT performed 4 weeks postpartum showed the hepatic hematoma had decreased in size to 12.6 × 6.4 × 15.1 cm and at 6 months postpartum had decreased to 3.8 × 2.2 × 3.1 cm and did not require any

204234,6439388-1,31020226,oa_noncomm/PMC006xxxxxx/PMC6439388.xml,Intravascular B-cell lymphoma: case report of a rare cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension,"A 53-year-old previously healthy man presented to a local hospital with 2 months of progressive dyspnoea, cough, and fevers. He had been previously treated for presumed bronchitis. Symptoms progressed with development of anorexia, nausea, night sweats, and pervasive fatigue. Past medical history was unremarkable except for history of prior smoking (accrued over 30 pack years) and occasional alcohol use. He was on no regular medications. He had immigrated from Iran to Los Angeles years prior. Per available documentation, physical examination at that time revealed a patient in moderate respiratory distress on Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) but with clear lungs, normal heart sounds, no jugular venous distention or pedal oedema, and no murmurs. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia with normal axis and non-specific ST-T changes (Figure ). Chest X-ray showed mildly pulmonary oedema, and he was treated with ceftriaxone 1 g IV and azithromycin 500 mg IV daily for 5 days. Laboratory evaluation revealed a normal white blood cell count (6300 cells/L), haemoglobin 13.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 226 000 per microliter. Serum creatinine was normal (1.2 mg/dL) and arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed a pH of 7.44, pCO2 30, and PaO2 145.
Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular systolic function, mild right ventricular (RV) enlargement and severely elevated pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure (65 mmHg) with mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. With failure to improve and progressive hypoxia and development of encephalopathy, antibiotic therapy was broadened to include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 800 mg/160 mg twice daily and fluconazole 400 mg IV daily. He underwent contrast computed tomography (CT) and CT pulmonary angiogram (CTA) (Figure and D), which revealed multifocal patchy and nodular areas of alveolar consolidation in both upper and lower lung fields suspicious for pneumonia, with sub-centimetre mediastinal lymph nodes and bilateral pleural effusions. There was no peribronchial thickening or interstitial fibrosis noted. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism and the PA was normal in size measuring 25 mm.
The patient developed progressive liver injury, with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 450 U/L (nl <46 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 302 U/L (nl <66 U/L) and elevated total and direct bilirubin which peaked at 20 (nl <1.3) and 19 (nl <0.3) mg/dL, respectively. He had progressive encephalopathy and despite normal coagulation parameters, was treated for presumed acute liver failure with N-acetylcysteine 1200 mg twice daily, lactulose 30 g three times daily, rifaximin 550 mg twice daily, and methylprednisolone 40 mg IV every 6 h. There were no identifiable reversible causes of liver injury. He developed oliguric renal insufficiency with creatinine increasing to 1.9 mg/dL (nl 0.8–1.3), microcytic anaemia with haemoglobin 9.7 g/dL (nl 13–17), and thrombocytopenia with 101 000 platelets per microliter (nl 150–450 000). Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated at 756 U/L (nl <260 U/L). Given his rapidly deteriorating clinical status, he was transferred to our institution for consideration of liver transplantation.
On arrival to our intensive care unit, he was noted to be afebrile with a heart rate of 124 b.p.m., blood pressure 124/79, and O2 saturation of 85% on 5 L nasal cannula. On exam, he was ill-appearing with temporal wasting and notably jaundiced with scleral icterus. He was confused. He had coarse rales anteriorly, was tachypnoeic using his accessory chest wall muscles. Cardiac exam revealed elevated jugular venous pressure of 10 cm of water, a regular tachycardia with a prominent P2 component of the second heart sound and soft holosystolic murmur at the right sternal border. He had hepatomegaly without ascites or splenic enlargement. He had no rashes and no oedema.
His ECG showed rightward axis with incomplete right bundle branch block (Figure ). A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a dilated (5.3 cm annulus, nl <4.2 cm) and severely hypokinetic right ventricle that, despite normal tricuspid annular motion (TAPSE 1.7 cm, nl >1.6 cm), had severely reducted systolic function with an akinetic apex and free wall. The left ventricle was underfilled, with ejection fraction of 75% and mild diastolic dysfunction. There was flattening of the septum in both systole and diastole, consistent with pressure overload, and estimated RV systolic pressure of 60 mmHg with a systolic blood pressure at the time of 104 mmHg (Figure ). There was moderate, central tricuspid regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation, as well a small pericardial effusion adjacent to the RV apex. Within few hours of arrival to the intensive care unit, he developed refractory shock. Cardiology was consulted for guidance in the management of RV failure in the setting of severe PH. He was started on dobutamine 3 μg/kg/min and epinephrine 10 μg/min, inhaled nitric oxide at 20 ppm, and inhaled epoprostenol 0.03 μg/kg/min. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated for severe metabolic acidosis with ABG showing pH 6.99, PaCO2 42 and PaO2 of 63, and anuric renal failure with creatinine peaking at 2.6 mg/dL. He was urgently intubated, however, despite aggressive efforts his condition worsened and he passed away from refractory cardiogenic shock due to RV failure.
A post-mortem examination was notable for the demonstration of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) with extensive involvement of the brain, heart, lungs and pulmonary arteries, as well as the spleen, both kidneys, thyroid, gastrointestinal tract, prostate, and both testes. Specifically, noted was the invasion of lymphoma cells into the small coronary vessels as well as the myocardial interstitium, as well as into the large and small pulmonary arteries and veins (Figure ).","[[53.0, 'year']]",M,2019-03,heart,"Intravascular B-cell lymphoma: case report of a rare cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension A 53-year-old previously healthy man presented to a local hospital with 2 months of progressive dyspnoea, cough, and fevers.

134690,10436638-1,37596520,oa_comm/PMC010xxxxxx/PMC10436638.xml,Novel compound heterozygous WDR35 variants in a Chinese patient associated with cranioectodermal dysplasia and ectopic testis: a case report and review of the literature,"A 3-year-and-3-month-old boy presented with abnormal renal function, frontal bossing, low-set ears, dolichocephaly, sparse hair, and short limbs. He was the seventh child of his unrelated parents and was delivered naturally at full term with a birth weight of 3.8 kg. He could walk at the age of 1 year and 3 months and has language retardation. On admission, a physical examination showed that the patient was developmentally delayed, with longer skull diameter, macrocephaly, sparse and delicate hair, narrow eye cleft, hypertelorism, low bridge of the nose, sparse teeth with dysplasia, short and curved fingers/toes, and the testes were not touched in the bilateral scrotum.
Computed tomography (CT) examination of the head revealed that the bilateral frontocephalic space had widened, the anteroposterior diameter of the skull had increased, and the sagittal suture was partially closed. Frontal chest radiographs showed increased heart volume, decreased bone density, and enlarged trabeculae. Electrocardiogram and color echocardiography were normal. The abdominal color ultrasound examination revealed that the liver volume was increased, the parenchymal echo was dense and enhanced, the intrahepatic hypoechoic mass was enlarged, and the intrahepatic bile duct was widened. Dysplasia of both kidneys enhanced parenchymal echo, unclear demarcation of the cortex and medulla, hydronephrosis of the right kidney and ureter, and dilatation of the left calyces. The spleen is enlarged with open sinuses. In particular, the child had an abnormal testicle position, with the right testicle located in the iliac fossa and the left testicle situated in the groin, and a hydrocele existed on both sides (Fig. A-H). These were not found in the previously reported CED patients.
The biochemical indicators of the patient showed that the urea value was 28.3 mmol/L (reference range: 1.7–7.1 mmol/L), the creatinine value was 432.1 umol/L (reference range: 18–80 umol/L), and the uric acid value was 393.8 umol/L (reference range: 134–415 umol/L). The 24-hour (h) urine volume was only 350 ml (reference range: 300-1500ml), and the 24 h urine protein quantity was 0.416 g (reference range: 0.03–0.15 g/24 h). Urine-specific gravity is 1.010 (reference range: 1.015–1.025), and pH is 7.0 (reference range: 5.5–6.5). The urinary protein and creatinine ratio was 4.32 mg/mmol (reference range: ≤0.2 mg/mmol), urinary microalbumin was 595.0 mg/L (reference range: 0–20 mg/L), α1-microglobulin was 39.56 mg/L (reference range: 0–12 mg/L), urinary transferrin was 2.52 mg/L (reference range:<1 mg/L), and urinary β2- microglobulin was 422.70 ug/L (reference range: 0-300 ug/L). His parathyroid hormone level was 739.400 pg/mL (reference range: 15–65 pg/mL). These data indicate that the child’s renal function is significantly abnormal. Moreover, routine blood tests showed that the value of erythrocytes was 2.28 × 1012/L (reference range: 3.5–5.5 × 1012/L) and the hemoglobin value was 65 g/L (reference range: 120–170 g/L), suggesting moderate anemia.
The patient had no family history and no genetic disease or nephropathy among his family members. He has three healthy sisters, and his mother has experienced three miscarriages (Fig. A). Because the child has a unique appearance and multi-system and multi-organ abnormalities of the body, we suspect he has a genetic disease. With the informed consent of the boy and his parents, we performed a trio-whole exome sequencing (trio-WES) for them and verified the results by Sanger sequencing. It was found that the patient carried a c.2590 C > T (p.Gln864*) nonsense variant and a c.2408_2416del (p.Asn803_Ala805del) in-frame variant of the WDR35 gene (NM_001006657), which were derived from his father and mother, respectively (Fig. B).
To our knowledge, this is the first CED patient caused by WDR35 variants in the Chinese population. Moreover, the child presented with a novel phenotype of ectopic testis except for showing typical CED characteristics. The patient carries a novel compound heterozygous variant that includes a c.2590 C > T nonsense variant and a c.2408_2416del in-frame variant derived from his father and mother, respectively. According to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, these two variants were classified as “pathogenic” and “uncertain” variants. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of WDR35 proteins from different species showed that p.Gln864 and p.Asn803_Ala805 are highly conserved across species (Fig. A), suggesting that amino acid sequences at these sites play a vital role in the function of this protein. The p.Gln864* variant can lead to a truncation of 318 amino acids at C-terminal, and the p.Asn803_Ala805 deletion causes the loss of three amino acids and generates an in-frame mutant protein (Fig. A-B). Using the same bioinformatic tools reported previously [], we analyzed the crystal structures of the mutant WDR35 protein by a SWISS-MODEL database with homology modeling using yeast β’-COP (3mkq.1.A) (Fig. C). The results showed that the crystal structure is truncated due to the p.Gln864* variant, which resulted in the disorder of the 3-dimensional system (Fig. C). This generates a loss of function of the protein. Alanine consistently stabilizes the helical conformation because it buries a more apolar area upon folding and because its backbone entropy is lower [], thus its loss might cause the altered conformation of the protein. Asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation is one of the most complex enzyme-catalyzed protein modification reactions. The modification can influence early events in protein folding, mediating significant effects locally, on the adjacent polypeptide sequence, and at remote sites distant from the modified asparagine residue []. Therefore, we speculate that the compound heterozygous variants in WDR35 may lead to the loss of function of the protein, which is pathogenic for the patient.
The child was given iron succinate and erythropoietin to improve anemia after a routine blood examination after admission. He had repeated metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia and was given acid correction, diuretic, and potassium-lowering treatments. However, the parents refused further treatment using renal replacement therapy for the child and were discharged voluntarily. The patient died when followed up six months later.","[[3.0, 'year'], [3.0, 'month']]",M,2023-08-18,heart,"Novel compound heterozygous WDR35 variants in a Chinese patient associated with cranioectodermal dysplasia and ectopic testis: a case report and review of the literature A 3-year-and-3-month-old boy presented with abnormal renal function, frontal bossing, low-set ears, dolichocephaly, sparse hair, and short limbs. He was the seventh child of his unrelated parents and was delivered naturally at full term with a birth weight of 3.8 kg. He could walk at the age of 1 year and 3 months and has language retardation. On admission, a physical examination showed that the patient was developmentally delayed, with longer skull diameter, macrocephaly, sparse and delicate hair, narrow eye cleft, hypertelorism, low bridge of the nose, sparse teeth with dysplasia, short and curved fingers/toes, and the testes were not touched in the bilateral scrotum.
Computed tomography (CT) examination of the head revealed that the bilateral frontocephalic space had widened, the anteroposterior diameter of the skull had increased, and the sagittal suture was partially closed. Frontal chest radiographs showed increased heart volume, decreased bone density, and enlarged trabeculae. Electrocardiogram and color echocardiography were normal. The abdominal color ultrasound examination revealed that the liver volume was increased, the parenchymal echo was dense and enhanced, the intrahepatic hypoechoic mass was enlarged, and the intrahepatic bile duct was widened. Dysplasia of both kidneys enhanced parenchymal echo, unclear demarcation of the cortex and medulla, hydronephrosis of the right kidney and ureter, and dilatation of the left calyces. The spleen is enlarged with open sinuses. In particular, the child had an abnormal testicle position, with the right testicle located in the iliac fossa and the left testicle situated in the groin, and a hydrocele existed on both sides (Fig. A-H). These were not found in the previously reported CED patients.
The biochemical indicators of the patient showed that the urea value was 28.3 mmol/L (reference range: 1.7–7.1 mmol/L), the creatinine value was 432.1 umol/L (reference range: 18–80 umol/L), and the uric acid value was 393.8 umol/L (reference range: 134–415 umol/L). The 24-hour (h) urine volume was only 350 ml (reference range: 300-1500ml), and the 24 h urine protein quantity was 0.416 g (reference range: 0.03–0.15 g/24 h). Urine-specific gravity is 1.010 (reference range: 1.015–1.025), and pH is 7.0 (reference range: 5.5–6.5). The urinary protein and creatinine ratio was 4.32 mg/mmol (reference range: ≤0.2 mg/mmol), urinary microalbumin was 595.0 mg/L (reference range: 0–20 mg/L), α1-microglobulin was 39.56 mg/L (reference range: 0–12 mg/L), urinary transferrin was 2.52 mg/L (reference range:<1 mg/L), and urinary β2- microglobulin was 422.70 ug/L (reference range: 0-300 ug/L). His parathyroid hormone level was 739.400 pg/mL (reference range: 15–65 pg/mL). These data indicate that the child’s renal function is significantly abnormal. Moreover, routine blood tests showed that the value of erythrocytes was 2.28 × 1012/L (reference range: 3.5–5.5 × 1012/L) and the hemoglobin value was 65 g/L (reference range: 120–170 g/L), suggesting moderate anemia.
The patient had no family history and no genetic disease or nephropathy among his family members. He has three healthy sisters, and his mother has experienced three miscarriages (Fig. A). Because the child has a unique appearance and multi-system and multi-organ abnormalities of the body, we suspect he has a genetic disease. With the informed consent of the boy and his parents, we performed a trio-whole exome sequencing (trio-WES) for them and verified the results by Sanger sequencing. It was found that the patient carried a c.2590 C > T (p.Gln864*) nonsense variant and a c.2408_2416del (p.Asn803_Ala805del) in-frame variant of the WDR35 gene (NM_001006657), which were derived from his father and mother, respectively (Fig. B).
To our knowledge, this is the first CED patient caused by WDR35 variants in the Chinese population. Moreover, the child presented with a novel phenotype of ectopic testis except for showing typical CED characteristics. The patient carries a novel compound heterozygous variant that includes a c.2590 C > T nonsense variant and a c.2408_2416del in-frame variant derived from his father and mother, respectively.

Because the patient refused admission, the attending physician prescribed the antibiotic moxifloxacin (0.4 g daily) and asked him to attend the outpatient department for follow-up.
The patient had no notable history of past illness.
The patient had no notable personal or family history.
The patient’s temperature was 38.5°C, pulse rate 129 beats/min, respiratory rate 42 beats/min, transcutaneous saturation of oxygen 65%, and blood pressure 85/55 mmHg (11.33/7.33 kPa) on admission.

He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation in synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation mode with the following settings: Fraction of inspired oxygen: 80%, positive end-expiratory pressure: 10 cm H2O, and pressure support: 15 cm H2O. His breathing was shallow with obvious moist crackles. No other abnormalities were detected on physical examination.
Routine blood testing 6 wk before admission revealed a high WBC count [14.63 × 109/L (normal range 3.5–9.5)], high CRP concentration [47.63 mg/L (< 8.0)], low RBC count [3.35 × 1012/L (4.30–5.80)], low hemoglobin [107.00 g/L (130–175)] and low platelet count [98 × 109/L (125–350)], indicating that he had inflammation and was anemic.

He was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage and hydrocephalus in another hospital. External brain drainage was undergone immediately, and his consciousness recovered after the operation. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed aortic dissection with intracranial aneurysms of the left vertebral artery and basilar artery. Then the patient was transferred to our hospital. Seven days later after admission, his condition suddenly deteriorated with shock (BP 85/58 mmHg) and hypoxemia (PaO2 58 mmHg) accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension, but without abdominal pain or early signs of peritonitis. Thoracic and abdominal CTA showed type B aortic dissection with the coarctated lumen of the initial segment of the superior mesenteric artery and a noticeable vessel tree in the enhanced sequence (Fig. ). The small intestine dilated and presented signs of paralytic intestinal obstruction. An ileus tube was inserted but the abdominal distension was not relieved significantly, and the symptoms of peritonitis gradually appeared. Abdominal CT showed that the small intestine was still extremely dilated with a paper-like thin wall even though the ileus tube was in the correct position. Intestinal wall pneumatosis was also observed (Fig. ). There was a sizeable gas–liquid level in the right subphrenic region which led to the diagnosis of perforation and emergency laparotomy.
At operation, the bowel wall supplied by the superior mesenteric artery appeared pale with palpable but weak pulsation of the peripheral artery, though there is no purplish-black necrosis. The small intestine was unable to be sutured since it was extremely dilated and easily to be ruptured due to a paper-thin and fragile wall. Besides, there were two typical perforated holes in the cecum and hepatic flexure of the colon with a significant amount of suppurative fluid in the abdominal cavity. Most of the small intestine and the whole right hemicolon were resected. The initial part of the jejunum approximately 8 cm long and the other two segments of the intestine approximately 55 and 37 cm long remained and were marked as No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3. Thickness of intestinal wall was the leading indicator for preservation. Pezzer's catheter was placed at the end of each segment and drawn out through the abdominal wall, and the end of the small intestine was fixed on the peritoneum (Fig. ).
The postoperative course was complicated. When radiography revealed that there is no leakage from the remaining intestinal segments, enteral nutrition started to be given gradually, which is beneficial for intestinal resuscitation and early nutritional support.
On June 19, the patient underwent endovascular repair of the aorta. Stents were placed in the left common carotid artery, innominate artery, and thoracic aorta. Postoperative angiography showed that the diameter of the true lumen of the abdominal aorta was widened, and the diameter of the SMA was also significantly widened (Fig. ). The blood supply to the digestive tract was improved.
Four days later, blood clots gushed from the NO. 3 intestine. We used a choledochoscope to detect the cause of bleeding because it was thin enough to pass through the drainage. A large clot was found in the middle part of the small intestine, tightly adhered to the intestinal wall with no active bleeding. Reperfusion injury was speculated to be the main reason for the bleeding after aortic repair. From July 11 to August 20, the NO. 1 and NO. 2 intestines were reconnected. The patients could intermittently take liquid food and enteral nutrition orally, while the supplementation of parenteral nutrition solution was reduced. Because of the obstruction, the NO. 3 intestine was not bridged to other segments.
Reconstruction of the digestive tract was performed on August 22. At operation, it was found that the middle part of the NO. 3 small intestine adhered tightly to the abdominal wall of the right iliac fossa and formed an angle. The digestive tract was reconstructed with end-to-end anastomosis, and the NO. 3 small intestine was anastomosed in the reverse peristaltic direction. The remaining small intestine was approximately 100 cm long. Postoperatively, the patient began to eat food on the seventh day and made a gradual recovery.
The patient ate regular food and did not need parenteral nutrition during the first eight months of follow-up. He maintained a weight above 49 kg, hemoglobin at a level of 110 g/L, and serum albumin greater than 40 g/L. He was also able to carry out light physical labor. However, after March 2019, his hemoglobin decreased progressively, and stool occult blood was positive. The test found that serum ferritin and vitamin B12 were low. Digestive endoscopy revealed multiple small polyps in the residual intestine. The patient was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia, and it was challenging to rectify this condition by giving vitamin B12, folic acid, and iron. Therefore, blood transfusion and parenteral nutrition were needed intermittently. Unfortunately, the patient's condition worsened in the following days. With chronic heart failure and malnutrition appearing, ectopic bacteria from the digestive tract, sepsis, and uncontrolled toxic shock finally occurred.

The patient has a significant medical history of hypertension, prediabetes, and iron deficient anemia, which resulted in hospitalization. Three months prior, he was diagnosed with a stage IIA adenocarcinoma of the cecum, and a stage IA2 primary, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positive non-small cell lung cancer of the right lower lobe (Figures -). Before presenting to the emergency department, he was seen in a walk-in clinic with the current symptoms where bilateral lower extremity venous duplex ultrasound was conducted. Results of this exam demonstrated a right-sided, acute DVT from the mid femoral vein down through the distal right peroneal veins and a partially occlusive thrombus in the right posterior tibial veins. There was also a non-occlusive acute DVT on the left lower extremity extending from the left popliteal vein down through the distal posterior tibial and peroneal veins. Finally, it revealed superficial thrombophlebitis of the small saphenous vein. Upon discovery of these findings, the patient was transported to the emergency department for further evaluation and management.
Initial vital signs in the emergency department showed a blood pressure of 151/94, pulse of 101, temperature of 100.2F, respiration rate of 19, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Initial physical exam demonstrated swelling in the right lower extremity, tenderness to palpation bilaterally behind the knee, and the skin was warm to the touch. Bilateral digital clubbing was also noted. Review of symptoms was positive for a 20-pound weight loss in the last three months and was negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, syncope, dark or bloody stools, bleeding, or craving ice. Initial lab studies were significant for hemoglobin of 5.8 and hematocrit of 21.5%; platelets were 470,000 and a stool guaiac test was positive.
Since his presenting conditions had a high suspicion of PE, a helical CT study was conducted. Results showed filling defects within the lobar branches of the right middle and lower lobes. Additional filling defects were identified within segmental and subsegmental branches of the right upper, middle, and lower lobes, as well as in the left lower lobe. Upon these findings in the emergency department, he was admitted to the internal medicine unit for further evaluation and management.
On the floor, he was given 2 units of packed red blood cells given the severe symptomatic anemia; he was started on a porcine heparin drip following hospital protocol at 20 units/kg/hr to treat the thromboembolisms. Hematology/oncology was consulted for further recommendations regarding anticoagulation in the setting of chronic slow lower GI bleed, and current bilateral DVTs, and PE. In addition, colorectal surgery was contacted because he was scheduled to undergo a right hemicolectomy the following day.
Following transfusion, his hemoglobin levels increased to 8.2 and remained stable for the remainder of the hospital admission. Hematology and oncology recommended the placement of a retrievable IVC filter to be used in the acute perioperative setting. Colorectal surgery consultation resulted in the planned right hemicolectomy being postponed until successful placement of the IVC filter. Four days after admission, with the help of fluoroscopic and sonographic guidance, an Option Elite (Argon Medical Devices, Plano, TX, USA) IVC filter was placed infrarenal without complications (Figure ).
On day seven of admission, the surgery team evaluated the patient and decided to move forward with the previously postponed procedure. They initiated bowel preparation and started the patient on a clear liquid diet which then transitioned to a 'no diet' at midnight with the maintenance of IV fluids prior to the operation. They also recommended pausing the porcine heparin drip for six hours leading up to surgery to avoid any excessive bleeding. The following day, a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal ileocolonic anastomosis was successfully performed without any immediate postoperative complications. On the days following the procedure, the patient was able to eat a normal healthy diet and have bowel movements regularly and without pain or bleeding. One month following the initial hospitalization, he returned to have the IVC filter removed, which was accomplished without complication. At that time, he was followed by pulmonology and thoracic surgery to address plans for future procedures to address the lung adenocarcinoma.","[[59.0, 'year']]",M,2022-08-20,heart,"Inferior Vena Cava Filter Use in the Setting of Gastrointestinal Blood Loss, Malignancy, and Multiple Thromboembolisms: A Case Report A 59-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department with a five-day history of right calf swelling and pain, as well as left calf pain.

The traumatic brain injury was caused by an accident at work, involving storage boxes falling over the patient. He presented severe cervicalgia, anterior cervical flexion, and generalized loss of active movement and sensation. On physical examination, the patient presented reduced cervical range of motion, short neck, low posterior hairline, apparent cervical kyphoscoliosis, and tetraplegia. Cervical kyphoscoliosis had never been investigated or treated previously. Around two hours after the accident, the patient presented hypoalgesia below T2 level. Muscle strength grading according to the AIS was 3/5 in left finger flexors, 4-/5 in left elbow extensors and finger abductors, 4-/5 in left hip flexors and knee extensors, with no other neurological deficits. According to the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale, the patient had a C7 AIS D lesion []. This classification means that C7 is the neurological level of injury, and it refers to the most caudal segment of the spinal cord with normal sensory and antigravity motor function on both sides of the body []. In this case, the patient had a D lesion, with motor function preserved at the most caudal sacral segments (tested by voluntary anal contraction) and had some sparing of motor function in his upper and lower extremities. To be considered a D lesion, the patient must have a muscle grade equal or superior to 3/5 in at least half of key muscles below the neurological level of injury (C7).
Regarding radiological findings, the cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal. The patient had both thoracic and lumbar abnormalities with incomplete T1 vertebra and spina bifida occulta (L4 posterior vertebral defect). Cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed important additional findings, which are described in Figures , .
Surgical cervical stabilization was attempted but the procedure was aborted due to lack of space for placing the anterior plate safely. During the 22 days of hospitalization, the patient wore a cervical collar and started a rehabilitation program including muscle strengthening, balance, and gait training. At discharge, he maintained a slight deficit of strength in his left upper and lower extremities but was able to walk with a walker. At discharge, the patient maintained a classification of C7 AIS D lesion. Rehabilitation treatment continued in an outpatient clinic and included 12 weeks of physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions three times a week.
The presence of spina bifida, scoliosis, hemivertebrae, and block vertebrae led to the following differential diagnosis: anatomical variant, Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS), Wildervanck syndrome, VACTERL association, and Aicardi syndrome. The patient did not have deafness or strabismus, which excluded Wildervanck syndrome []. Imaging examination did not find tracheoesophageal, kidney, or cardiac anomalies. The absence of cleft palate, limb abnormalities, cardiac defects, or anal atresia excluded VACTERL association []. Aicardi syndrome was excluded because the cranial MRI did not reveal agenesis of the corpus callosum and physical examination did not show any characteristics of Klinefelter syndrome. Aicardi syndrome only affects women or males with 47, XXY chromosome constitution []. The most likely diagnoses were Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) or anatomical variant.

Preoperative coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) after the origin of the first diagonal branch (). Percutaneous coronary intervention was not performed because of its technical difficulty and contraindication for perioperative anticoagulation. To minimize the operative trauma, we performed simultaneous MIDCAB via a small left thoracotomy and thoracoscopic wedge resection of the lung lesion.
The patient was anesthetized and intubated with a double-lumen endotracheal tube. Single-lung ventilation was used to facilitate exposure for harvesting of the left internal thoracic artery. The patient was positioned supine with 30° rotation toward the right decubitus position by means of a rolled towel. External pads for emergency defibrillation were placed on the right anterior and left posterior sides of the chest wall. A 5-cm left anterior thoracotomy incision was then created along the inframammary line and tunneled into the fourth intercostal space according to the preoperative chest X-ray and coronary angiography images. After harvesting of the left internal thoracic artery, a pericardial incision was made to expose and stabilize the LAD with a specially designed minimally invasive stabilizer. The coronary anastomosis was performed using a continuous running suture technique (8-0 suture) and intracoronary shunting.
After heparin neutralization and switching of the single-lung ventilation to the other side, the patient was positioned supine with 30° rotation toward the left decubitus position. A 4-cm incision in the fifth intercostal space was made along the right anterior axillary line for wedge resection of the dorsal segment of the right inferior pulmonary lobe using a thoracoscopic linear stapler with a blue reload. After the surgery, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and recovered well. She was discharged on postoperative day 8. A perioperative red blood cell transfusion was not necessary. The patient’s postoperative mechanical ventilation time was 12 h. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed a normal ejection fraction and heart chamber. Pathologic examination of the lung lesion showed a moderately differentiated metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma. The lesion was positive for cytokeratin (CK), CK20, Ki-67, CDX2, and carcinoembryonic antigen as determined by immunohistochemistry.

There was family history of diabetes mellitus for the father and allergy to inhalants from the mother. He was second-born by normal delivery of consanguineous parents (first degree cousins); weight at birth was 3015 gr. From the age of five, the symptoms of polydipsia and polyuria have increased. At 10 years old, he suffered from a fracture of his left foot after a trauma of mild intensity. A physical examination revealed evidence of growth cessation. The patient’s weight and height were below the third percentile of growth (35, 4 Kg; 143 cm) and delayed puberty was diagnosed (absent pubarche, testicular volume 6-8 cc, penis stage was the third). At the time of admission, the patient’s clinical condition was poor, skin turgor was reduced, muscles appeared norm tonic but slightly hypertrophic. Thoracic, cardiac and abdominal examinations were normal. There was no clinical sign of neurologic diseases. Speech ability and school performance were good. Laboratory findings at admission were normal; the only abnormal values were hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia and hyper transaminasemia: (Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) 47 U/L and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) 81 U/L while the normal ranges are 5-42). The diagnostic work-up for growth cessation and delayed puberty were initiated, but all of the findings were normal: thyroid hormones, gonadotropins, and IGF-1 and anti-transglutaminase antibodies. Hand and wrist x-rays confirmed the development of ossification centers in relation to chronological age (the corresponding skeletal age was 13 years old). Because of the presence of polyuria, urine specimens were examined for spot and a 24-hour sample confirmed intense polyuria (6000 ml), high urinary calcium level (670 mg; v.n. 100-300) , with normal excretion of other electrolytes, and low urinary creatinine (660 mg/24 h; v.n. 800-2000). Creatinine clearance was reduced: 70 ml/min (v.n. >100 ml/min). We tested the plasma and urinary osmolarity which were normal; the ultrasonography of abdomen showed hyper echogenic liver and pyramidal calcification of kidneys with enhanced corticomidollary differentiation features suggestive of medullary nephrocalcinosis (), and gallbladder lithiasis. Brain and pituitary gland magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal abnormality, neither in brain parenchyma nor Sella and parasellar regions. We checked calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, renin angiotensin aldosterone system and all results were found normal. Plasmatic, urinary amino acid levels and urinary acid organics did not reveal an abnormal pattern. In order to assess a possible cause for hyper transaminasemia lipid subset, alpha 1 antitrypsin, and liver kidney microsome tests were done. The complete infectivological panel did not reveal any abnormalities. The blood gas analysis showed a normal pH and bicarbonate level. The characteristics were compatible with an incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis that is the sign of WD. Finally the levels of serum concentration of copper and ceruloplasmin were 21 mcg/dl, v.n. 70-140 and 4 mg/dl v.n. 22-58 respectively which is another possible suggestion of WD. This suspicion was confirmed by elevated copper urinary excretion (111.30 mcg/24 hours’ urine; v.n. 0-50). Liver biopsy showed typical signs of WD when viewed on an electron microscope: mild lymphocytic infiltrate and eosinophilia granulocyte, no piecemeal necrosis, fatty liver degeneration (steatosis) to medium and small lipid droplets with moderate diffuse nuclear glycogenation, numerous Mallory bodies and lobular activity. Copper’s content was 270 μg/g dry weight of liver. Slit-lamp eye examination did not reveal the presence of typical Kayser-Fleischer ring, while a bone density scan revealed significant bone demineralization (). Molecular tests confirmed, through direct DNA sequencing, the presence of a mutation in homozygosis N1270S (belong to exon 18). We started therapy with D-Penicillamine (20 mg/Kg/day) given in three doses, one hour prior meals, B-vitamin complex and a low copper diet. Moreover, we initiated therapy for osteoporosis with Alendronate (70 mg/weekly) and calcium and D vitamin complex. After two months a decrease in urinary copper and calcium excretion were revealed. The ultrasonography features of mild hepatitis responded to treatment and hypercalciuria was slightly decreased while nephrocalcinosis was unchanged.","[[16.0, 'year']]",M,2012-08,liver,"Hypercalciuria and Nephrocalcinosis as Early Feature of Wilson Disease Onset: Description of a Pediatric Case and Literature Review A 16 years old boy came to our attention because of polyuria (about eight liters of urine) and polydipsia associated with asthenia.

3091,2709639-1,19538751,oa_comm/PMC002xxxxxx/PMC2709639.xml,Case report: Malignant teratoma of the uterine corpus,"An 82-year-old lady was referred to gynaecology outpatients in June 2007 with a one month history of post menopausal bleeding. Her past gynaecological history included a negative hysteroscopy in 1998, and previous use of hormone replacement therapy. She had previously given birth to two children. The patient was fit and well, with no significant past medical history apart from hypertension for which she took bendroflumethiazide and atenolol.
Physical examination revealed a bulky uterus with no adnexal masses. A pipelle biopsy demonstrated only tiny fragments of blood clot. A subsequent transvaginal ultrasound scan showed a large endometrial mass with calcification (Figure ). The ovaries appeared normal. She underwent a hysteroscopy in July 2007 when a 6 cm uterine fibrotic polyp, which filled the uterine cavity, was removed.
Microscopy demonstrated polypoid tissue with a variably cellular and fibrotic stroma, focal adipose and possible chondroid metaplasia, but no malignant features. The glands showed focal mucinous and keratinising sqaumous epithelial metaplasia. There was focal nuclear atypia, focal mitotic activity and occasional cribriform gland fusion. These features were in keeping with either atypical complex hyperplasia within an endometrial polyp associated with metaplastic changes, or a polypoid uterine teratoma.
Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining of the small crowded epithelium for the epithelial marker cytokeratin (CK)-7 and the thyroid and lung marker TTFI. There was positive staining of the chondroid area for S100 protein, focal staining of dilated gland epithelium and stromal cells for oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, and staining of stromal cells for smooth muscle α-actin (SMA). Thyroglobulin, desmin, CK20 and CDX2 staining was negative. A diagnosis of benign teratoma with thyroid gland and cartilaginous elements was therefore made.
Following hysteroscopy, the bleeding continued. A repeat ultrasound scan revealed that the teratoma had grown back almost completely filling the uterine cavity. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in November 2007 showed the tumour filling and distending the endometrial cavity and extending down into the cervix (Figure ). There was evidence of posterior wall myometrial invasion but there was no lymphadenopathy and the ovaries appeared normal. Tumour markers including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and Ca19-9 were within normal limits. Serum Ca125 was slightly elevated at 42 U/ml (normal range 0–35 units (U)/ml) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) raised at 372 IU/L (normal range 125–250 U/ml).
The patient proceeded to a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectmy in December 2007. At operation, the uterus was found to contain a haemorrhagic polypoid tumour (110 × 80 × 70 mm) arising from the posterior aspect of the endometrial cavity (Figure ). Uterine size was equivalent to that of a 12-week gestation uterus.
Microscopically the tumour was a teratoma containing mature and immature elements with mixed malignant transformation (Figure ). The tissue types found included squamous and glandular epithelium, thyroid parenchyma, smooth muscle, connective and adipose tissue. In addition there were areas of immature bone, invasive adenocarcinoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. There was extensive lymphovascular invasion and deep myometrial, but not serosal, involvement. The omentum, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries were free of tumour. Immunohistochemistry showed that the malignant epithelial components were positive for CK-7 and TTF-1, but negative for CK20 and thyroglobulin. One area of the tumour stained positive for desmin but not for SMA, S100 or CD10, suggesting that this is likely to be a small focus of myogenic sarcoma.
The histopathological conclusion was of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and a focal myogenic sarcoma arising in a polypoid uterine teratoma with mature and immature elements. A post-operative computer tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis found no evidence of distant disease giving an overall International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) disease stage 1C.
The patient recovered well from surgery and was referred for oncological follow up. Given her age and performance status a surveillance approach was taken with regular clinical examinations, serial tumour markers and routine CT scans. Initially in remission, six months post-operatively para-aortic lymphadenopathy was detected on CT although she remained asymptomatic with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0. In view of her age and wishes for a treatment with acceptable toxicity, the patient was commenced on an initial dose of cisplatin (20 mg/m2) and etoposide (100 mg/m2). This was well tolerated so one week later treatment was continued with a fortnightly alternating regimen of paclitaxel (135 mg/m2) and etoposide (150 mg/m2), followed by paciltaxel (135 mg/m2) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2). This treatment was chosen based on our experience of its effectiveness and tolerability in the treatment of relapsed germ cell tumours and gestational trophoblastic disease [,].
After three cycles of chemotherapy there was a reduction in the size of the para-aortic mass, but an increase in the cystic component suggesting possible differentiation towards a mature teratoma. Consequently she underwent a retro-peritoneal lymph node dissection in October 2008. Histology from this confirmed the presence of metastatic teratoma. Unfortunately she had a turbulent post-operative course and, although she recovered well enough to return home a month later, she sadly died shortly thereafter.","[[82.0, 'year']]",F,2009,cervical,"Case report: Malignant teratoma of the uterine corpus An 82-year-old lady was referred to gynaecology outpatients in June 2007 with a one month history of post menopausal bleeding.

Her past medical history was significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and degenerative lumbar spinal disease. She was a lifelong smoker who was independent in her daily activities. She presented to her local hospital with symptoms of neck pain and stiffness but denied any chest pain. She was hemodynamically stable and underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan. The scan revealed no obvious vertebral fractures but did reveal a focal pseudoaneurysm along the left lateral wall of the aortic arch between the origins of the left common carotid and subclavian arteries (
). This measured 19 mm in maximum anteroposterior dimension. She was subsequently referred to the vascular surgical team, who agreed to manage her conservatively with yearly CT scans.
Eleven months later, the patient represented to her local hospital with sudden onset of chest pain radiating to her back. Initial observations were unremarkable. A repeat CT of the aorta demonstrated the aneurysm with no significant size increase compared with the previous CT scan. The vascular surgical team felt that an endovascular approach would not be suitable owing to the proximity of the lesion to the head and neck vessels. Transthoracic echocardiogram and coronary angiography were normal.
The patient underwent surgery via a median sternotomy. The aortic arch and the head and neck vessels were dissected. The pseudoaneurysm was identified and appeared isolated to the greater curve on the left lateral aspect of the arch (

He presented with complaints of pain, swelling, and purulent discharge from his left shoulder. The swelling had an insidious onset over the last four months and was associated with pain and a yellow-colored, non-foul-smelling discharge for the past 15 days.
He was a stationery shop owner with no history of tuberculosis among his contacts. However, he had a history of a road-traffic accident 1.5 years ago where he sustained a fracture of the left clavicle. He was treated for the same at a local orthopedic clinic, on which no details are available. There was no history of constitutional signs of tuberculosis, and there was no history of substance abuse or stays at crowded places, such as prisons and refugee shelters.
A general examination was suggestive of a young man with a weight of 78.9 kg and afebrile to touch. He had blood pressure of 120/80 mm of Hg, pulse of 73 per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturation at room air of 98%. His systemic examination was not suggestive of any disease. The local examination was remarkable for a swollen left shoulder with a discharging wound from the proximal arm measuring about 9 x 5 cm with clear edges and purulent discharge coming from it (Figure ).
Further, there was no clubbing, cyanosis, icterus, or pedal edema, but there was left axillary lymphadenopathy. Overhead abduction was restricted on the left side (Figure ).
A plain radiograph of the left shoulder joint was suggestive of a sclerotic lesion in the neck of the left scapula, and an old fractured left clavicle with a malunion was seen (Figure ).
A diagnostic laboratory workup, presuming he was a case of pyogenic abscess with differentials including tuberculous osteomyelitis, bone tumor, and fungal osteomyelitis, was remarkable for a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (52 mm in the first hour), a raised C-reactive protein (36.40 mg/L), and a positive Mantoux test (20 x 20 mm induration). Additionally, his induced sputum examination and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification of the same were negative. His HIV (I and II) and hepatitis panels were also negative. His chest X-ray was normal.
The magnetic resonance imaging of the left upper arm was suggestive of an area of lysis involving the neck of the scapula, including the inferior cortex. There was evidence of contiguous synovial thickening with abnormal hyperintensity, which extended to involve the anterior and posterior bands of the inferior gleno-humeral ligament in the region of the axillary pouch. There was further extension along the dorsal aspect lateral to the left teres minor that extended up to the subcutaneous plane. There was the formation of a large hyperintense collection located superficially to the left triceps, measuring 5.3 cm x 9 cm x 11.4 cm. There were also small ramifications of the collection extending along the antero-inferior aspect of the left subscapularis. Also, a sub-centimeter-sized level III axillary lymph node was visible. Additionally, an old malunited fracture of the lateral third of the left clavicle was noted (Figures -).
An ultrasound-guided aspiration was done through which approximately 200 ml of pus was removed. A cytological examination of the pus showed necrotic material, caseation, epitheloid cells, and a granulomatous lesion with a few Langhans giant cells. However, the Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli was negative. Meanwhile, the cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification of the pus was suggestive of very low levels of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with resistance to rifampicin. The presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was verified by a subsequent, sensitive culture on liquid culture using the Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGITTM 960 system (Becton Dickinson India Pvt. Ltd., Gurugram, India)).
A final diagnosis of rifampicin mono-resistant extrapulmonary tuberculosis of the scapula with cold abscesses was made. After a pre-treatment evaluation, he was initiated on an all-oral longer treatment regimen per the national guidelines (Table ) [].
For his pain, a tablet of diclofenac was added for once- or twice-daily use. Presently, he is on treatment for two weeks with no major adverse drug reactions to the second-line antituberculous drugs. Moreover, he was regularly counseled for treatment adherence and regular follow-ups.

Since the age of 48, she complained of progressive, dramatic hirsutism, receding hairline, male-like muscular hypertrophy and voice deepening. She referred normal menses from the age of 12 to 45, when she became amenorrhoic. She reported spontaneous pregnancy at the age of 34, after multiple unsuccessful ovulation inductions. During the preceding seven years, bloodletting treatments were performed twice a month, because of severe polycythemia (RBC count: 5.95 million cells/μL; Haemoglobin: 14g/dl; haematocrit level >45%) without increased serum erythropoietin levels (18.8 mIU/ml, n.v. 3.7-31.5 - see Table ). The occurrence of normal erythropoietin concentrations were in keeping with a similar observation previously reported by Yetkin et al. [], suggesting that erythropoietin secretion could not be involved in hyperandrogenism-associated polycythemia. Three months before our evaluation the patient experienced a stroke. Since then she was on warfarin and levetiracetam treatment.

Gynaecological examination was negative, except for clitoromegaly and a huge solid, firm and irregular mass detected in the outer-lower quadrant of the left breast. For this reason she underwent lumpectomy, before endocrine investigation. Since histology revealed infiltrative ductal breast carcinoma, the patient underwent conventional radiotherapy (total dose: 45 Gy).
Results of endocrine evaluation, performed after radiotherapy, are shown in Table . Free and total testosterone and dihydrotestosterone values were dramatically increased. Also serum 17-OH progesterone and androstenedione levels were slightly elevated. On the contrary, circulating cortisol and DHEAS concentrations were within the normal range. One-mg dexamethasone overnight administration induced appropriate suppression of cortisol and DHEAS levels (1.46 and 14.94 ug/dl respectively) and partially reduced 17-OH progesterone values (1.6 ng/ml). Serum LH and FSH levels were undetectable, while levels of other pituitary hormones were within the normal range. Ovarian tumour markers (CA 125, beta-HCG, CA 15.3, CEA) were also negative.
Trans-vaginal pelvic ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography (CT) were negative, showing normal ovarian size and morphology. Moreover, Positron Emission Tomography (PET), performed by Fluorine-18-Deoxyglucose and implemented by CT, was negative for abdominal or pelvic neoplasms. Other authors described previously usefulness of PET-CT in identification of small ovarian neoplasms [,].
After starting the treatment for breast malignancy we advised oophorectomy supposing that the origin of increased testosterone levels might be placed in the ovary.
Since the patient refused surgery, she was treated by flutamide (500 mg/day, p. os) for six months. This therapy normalized blood cell count and haematocrit (RBC count: 4.84 million cells/μL; Haemoglobin: 12.4 g/dl; HCT 40%) in few weeks, allowing the withdrawal of bloodletting treatments (Table ). Nevertheless, virilization features were slightly reduced (FG score = 26). On the other hand, treatment with Leuprorelin or other GnRH analogues, which is usually performed in patients with hyperthecosis or other gonadotropin-dependent hyperandrogenism, was inapplicable in our patient with undetectable FSH and LH levels [,,]. Finally the patient accepted to undergo bilateral oophorectomy, which allowed the identification of a 8-mm ovarian tumour within the right ovary.
Seven days after oophorectomy, testosterone levels decreased dramatically and gonadotropin values reached menopausal range (Table ). Three months later, hirsutism slightly improved (FG score = 21) but plethora disappeared. Moreover, hemochromocytometric parameters normalized completely (RBC count: 4.72 million cells/μL; Haemoglobin: 12.5 g/dl; HCT 38%) without any medication, and bloodletting therapy was no longer required.
Ovarian tumour was located at the hilum and composed by cells arranged in clusters, with granular cytoplasm, cytoplasmic inclusions and round nuclei (Figure ). Pathology was indicative for the diagnosis of Leydig-cell tumour. Ki67 index was <1%.
Breast tumour histological examination showed infiltrative ductal carcinoma, moderately differentiated (score 6 sec. Elston Ellis). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that oestrogen receptors (ER) were negative (0%), but AR and PR were detected in 100% and 25% of tumour cells, respectively (Figure ). HER2 status was negative (0%). Ki67 index was <10%. Some authors demonstrated that AR are expressed in 80% of invasive breast cancers, but only in 21% of all ER-ve tumours []. On the contrary, most ER+ve breast neoplasms are negative for AR []. In the experience of Micello et al. [] AR is frequently expressed in ER-ve/PR-ve breast cancer, in which expression of HER2 and AR is highly correlated. However, in our patient HER2-receptor expression was negative.","[[56.0, 'year']]",F,2013,heart,"Occult leydig cell tumour and androgen-receptor positive breast cancer in a woman with severe hyperandrogenism A 56-year old woman was referred to our Endocrine Unit because of severe virilisation. Since the age of 48, she complained of progressive, dramatic hirsutism, receding hairline, male-like muscular hypertrophy and voice deepening. She referred normal menses from the age of 12 to 45, when she became amenorrhoic. She reported spontaneous pregnancy at the age of 34, after multiple unsuccessful ovulation inductions. During the preceding seven years, bloodletting treatments were performed twice a month, because of severe polycythemia (RBC count: 5.95 million cells/μL; Haemoglobin: 14g/dl; haematocrit level >45%) without increased serum erythropoietin levels (18.8 mIU/ml, n.v. 3.7-31.5 - see Table ). The occurrence of normal erythropoietin concentrations were in keeping with a similar observation previously reported by Yetkin et al. [], suggesting that erythropoietin secretion could not be involved in hyperandrogenism-associated polycythemia. Three months before our evaluation the patient experienced a stroke.

He denied any serious medical condition and is currently still smoking 20 pack-years. The patient received treatment, including aspirin 324 mg, clopidogrel 300 mg, enoxaparin 30 mg IV (initial dose) followed by 60 mg SC (total daily dose), and noradrenaline at 0.49 μg/kg/min, before being transferred to our centre. Upon admission, his presentation included pallor, cold extremities, a heart rate of 110 b.p.m., a blood pressure reading of 90/60 mmHg with the administration of noradrenaline, an elevated respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 94% while receiving oxygen through a 10 L per minute mask. The patient’s condition further deteriorated, presenting severe hypotension requiring an escalation of vasopressor therapy. The emergency electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in leads V1–V4 and aVR (). The echocardiography revealed global hypokinesis of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 14% (). Laboratory findings indicated a significantly elevated hs troponin I level of 1286.1 ng/L (reference range: <34). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a mixed acid–base disorder with a pH of 7.093, PaCO2 of 43.8 mmHg, HCO3− of 13.4 mmol/L, and PaO2 of 95 mmHg. Other test results were presented in .
The confirmed diagnosis by the 6th hour was ST-elevation myocardial infarction progressing to Killip IV, accompanied by Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) D–CS, indicative of acute decompensated heart failure. Following the consensus of the heart team, the patient underwent peripheral VA ECMO through femoral veno-arterial cannulation in the catheterization lab within 30 min before emergent PCI. The vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) of the patient at the time of initiating VA ECMO was calculated to be 164 points. Coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the left main coronary artery (LMCA), 70–80% stenosis of the mid-right coronary artery, and 80% stenosis of the posterior descending artery (; , ). The LMCA–LAD I was intervened with a 3.0 × 4 mm stent, achieving TIMI III flow (see , ).
After a successful PCI, the patient was transferred to the coronary care unit for ongoing recovery.

He reported sharp, debilitating frontal headaches that radiated over the temples bilaterally. The headaches were associated with fever, fatigue, and myalgias. The patient’s past medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, prostate cancer, and rectal cancer. Symptoms began two days after he received the second dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. He was seen at an outside hospital emergency department at the onset of symptoms. Infectious workup with chest radiography and urinalysis was unremarkable. He was diagnosed with a mild vaccine reaction and discharged from the emergency department. His symptoms persisted for another week, and he presented to our institution, where he was admitted for further evaluation. Lab workup was remarkable for leukocytosis to 16.9 K/uL (3.5-10.5K/uL), mild transaminitis, and elevated inflammatory markers, with CRP 272 mg/L (<8.1 mg/L) and ESR 97 mm/hr (0-20 mm). Infectious workup, with urinalysis and blood cultures, and head imaging, with CT and MRI, were unremarkable. His headache improved slightly with acetaminophen and IV fluids, and he was discharged after three days. At his follow-up office visit a week later, his headache had become much worse with associated fatigue, scalp tenderness, and three episodes of transient blurred vision in the right and left eye. Each episode resolved after five minutes. He was readmitted due to concern for GCA. On admission, his ophthalmic exam was unremarkable, but he was treated with 60mg oral prednisone due to high suspicion for GCA. His headache completely resolved less than 12 hours after the administration of steroids. Bilateral temporal artery biopsies were performed the next day, which can be seen in Figures -.
Both biopsies revealed patchy intramural inflammatory infiltrates composed of lymphocytes and rare multinucleated giant cells at the internal lamina and adventitia consistent with a diagnosis of GCA. The patient was discharged on high-dose prednisone (60mg daily), and three weeks later, his CRP and ESR improved to <1 mg/L and 2 mm/hr, respectively.

Each episode resolved after five minutes. He was readmitted due to concern for GCA. On admission, his ophthalmic exam was unremarkable, but he was treated with 60mg oral prednisone due to high suspicion for GCA. His headache completely resolved less than 12 hours after the administration of steroids. Bilateral temporal artery biopsies were performed the next day, which can be seen in Figures -.
Both biopsies revealed patchy intramural inflammatory infiltrates composed of lymphocytes and rare multinucleated giant cells at the internal lamina and adventitia consistent with a diagnosis of GCA. The patient was discharged on high-dose prednisone (60mg daily), and three weeks later, his CRP and ESR improved to <1 mg/L and 2 mm/hr, respectively. He was tapered to prednisone 50mg daily by his six-week follow-up appointment without recurrence of symptoms.

Colonoscopy (CS) revealed that the tumor involved a half-circumferential surface and covered the area above and below the anterior peritoneal reflection, extending to the anal margin (Fig. a). The whole lesion was soft and magnifying chromoendoscopy using crystal violet staining identified a type IV pit pattern (Fig. b). Thus, we diagnosed the lesion as an adenoma or intramucosal adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) showed no lymph node metastasis or obvious distant metastasis (Fig. a), and ESD was performed. Although intraoperative microperforation occurred, en bloc resection was successfully performed. The microperforation was treated conservatively, and CT was repeated after 1 week. The repeated CT showed a liver mass suspicious of metastasis (Fig. b) and Gd-EOB–DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple liver metastases (Fig. c, d). The resected specimen was 103 × 88 mm in size and contained an 88 × 82 mm tumor. Histopathological analysis showed tubular adenocarcinoma with an NEC component. The final pathological diagnosis was: rectal cancer, ESD.- type 0–IIa, 68 × 60 mm (carcinoma size), adenocarcinoma (tub1 > tub2) with neuroendocrine carcinoma component, pT1b at least (SM,3.8 mm), INFb, Ly1b (D2-40), V1b (EVG), Pn0, BD1, pHM0 (adenoma positive), pVM1. The NEC component was less than 3% of the total tumor, measuring about 5 mm (Fig. ), and was found in the most advanced part of the infiltrate (T1b at least; SM3.8 mm) (Fig. a, b). The NEC component was positive for synaptophysin (Fig. c), negative for chromogranin A, very focally positive for CK5/6, and negative for p40. In addition, MIB1 labeling was 70% (Fig. d), necrosis was present, and the nuclear fission image was approximately 28/10 high power fields. NEC components were found to follow the shape of the glandular ducts (Fig. e). In addition, some of the adenocarcinomas bordering the NEC stained positive for synaptophysin (Fig. f, g). Liver metastasis was thought to be caused by the NEC component. Throughout the course of disease, a liver biopsy was performed, which confirmed that the liver metastasis was due to the NEC component (Fig. h). The patient then decided to proceed with chemotherapy, and irinotecan plus cisplatin was selected as the first line.","[[69.0, 'year']]",F,2022-08-31,liver,"A case of a tiny neuroendocrine carcinoma in a large flat-elevated rectal tumor causing multiple liver metastases A 69-year-old woman was referred to our institution for treatment of a large flat-elevated rectal tumor.

His main complaint was intense epigastric pain radiating through to his back. The GP noted he was centrally cyanosed, tachypnoeic, febrile (39.5°C) and intermittently drowsy, so urgent transfer to hospital by ambulance was arranged. He was promptly attended in the emergency department, where worsening tachypnoea, abdominal pain, and profound central and peripheral cyanosis were noted. His skin was generally mottled and dusky, and there was evolving purple discolouration of his fingers, toes, nose, ears and lips. His extremities were cold to touch. He was distressed and mildly confused. Focused neurological, respiratory and abdominal examinations were otherwise unremarkable. Face mask oxygen was administered, intravenous access was secured, and 3000 mL intravenous crystalloid was given within the first 2 hours. Blood cultures were taken by separate venipuncture, but only after he had received his first dose of intravenous antibiotics. Parenteral opioid analgesia was titrated to relieve pain and distress.
Significant medical history included hereditary spherocytosis with splenectomy in childhood. He had maintained prophylactic immunisation but did not take regular antibiotics. He suffered a right-sided precentral gyrus infarct (stroke) in early adulthood, after which an incidental patent foramen ovale was detected. Rehabilitation was complete, with no residual neurological deficits.
Initial blood results demonstrated marked neutrophilia with bands, acute kidney injury and DIC. Liver function tests were mildly elevated, and serum lipase was normal (). Chest X-ray and 12-lead ECG were both unremarkable. CT of his abdomen was reported as showing bilateral perinephric stranding and pancreatic inflammation. Microbiology samples of blood and urine were sent. Pneumococcal DNA was detected in blood via PCR, and antigen for S. pneumoniae was detected in urine.
Following the first 1000 mL intravenous crystalloid bolus, the patient’s blood pressure incremented slightly and his mental state improved. However, the prolonged central capillary refill time, mottled skin, and deep cyanosis of his ears, nose, lips, hands and feet visibly worsened, despite further volume resuscitation. A radial arterial line was inserted for haemodynamic monitoring and blood gas analysis, revealing a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate and respiratory alkalosis, all typical of early sepsis ().
Despite haemodynamic stability, ongoing clinical concern warranted admission to intensive care unit (ICU), where central venous access was inserted. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a well-filled heart with a normal systolic ejection fraction and no valvular lesions. ‘Normal’ function, however, was considered inadequate owing to the unimproved peripheral circulatory signs, persistent lactic acidosis and now established anuria, despite adequate blood pressure. Milrinone was commenced at 0.25 µg/kg/min, without bolus, to improve peripheral perfusion and augment cardiac output. Over the next 20 min, his ears, nose, lips and central capillary refill all visibly improved, and urine appeared. Despite easily palpable radial and dorsalis pedis pulses (also audible on Doppler ultrasound), both hands and feet remained cold and were now numb. His digits were symmetrically purple-black. Over the next few hours, this numbness was gradually replaced by pain and paraesthesiae, particularly in the fingers.
In the absence of active bleeding, the DIC was not treated with clotting factors or plasma products owing to concerns these could increase the risk of microvascular thrombi in his digits and potentially worsen the situation.
Early referrals were made to several specialty teams, including vascular surgeons, to consider the optimal management of the profound digital ischaemia. The treatments recommended, and those provided, are detailed in .
The patient was competent to provide consent for his own care throughout his illness, although in hindsight he recognised his ‘thoughts were clouded’ in the first 24 hours of his admission. He was most concerned about any intervention that might increase his risk of another stroke.
Catheter-directed, intra-arterial thrombolysis was discussed and dismissed. There is no consensus on agent or dosage, and the risk of inadvertent systemic thrombolysis is unknown in the setting of concurrent administration into multiple vessels in the presence of DIC. He was willing to accept systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin, as this is commonly used in ICUs and can be rapidly reversed with protamine. The theoretical therapeutic intent was thrombus prevention. This was started 16 hours after ICU admission, using a standard protocol.
The patient reported feeling an instant benefit with intravenous heparin. He said that his fingers felt warmer and started to regain feelings, although more painful ones. Objectively, there was little improvement. The visible zones of colour demarcation were not appreciably different, and the digits remained cold to touch. The infusion was continued and monitored by serial activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).
Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) paste was applied to his hands but was soon removed because of severe headache, which then resolved. Subsequent systemic administration of intravenous GTN provided no obvious benefit, or side effects, but it was continued, nevertheless.
A right-sided axillary plexus block with lignocaine, epinephrine and clonidine provided temporary and welcome analgesia to the right hand. The block was technically successful in that the arm lost motor function and his wrist and forearm were appreciably warmer to touch, but there was no visible indication of circulatory improvement in the hand. It was thus not repeated on the left side. Additional concern over possible cumulative local anaesthetic toxicity was another factor in that decision. The motor block lasted over 8 hours.
Over the next 72 hours, there was a steady and marked improvement in both the appearance and function of all four limbs, more so in his hands than his feet. This seems to be the usual pattern reported in other cases. Milrinone was ceased after 24 hours, GTN was continued for 68 hours, and heparin was continued for 72 hours. Gabapentin and oxycodone made his pain bearable. At the time of ICU discharge, the patient’s fingers were no longer purple, but they were still dusky and swollen (). Gangrenous demarcation was evident in both feet ().
Topical application of alcohol and betadine-soaked dressings began under the surgical team’s direction after transfer to the ward.

She reported 1 month of left lower extremity pain that was progressively worsening. She explained that exercise exacerbated the condition, which also persisted at rest. One day before admission, she could not walk because of worsening calf pain. She denied any other GI or GU complaint, such as an inability to pass gas or any changes to her bowel or bladder function. There was no use of tobacco or alcohol. No history of prior trauma or instrumentation of the lower limb arteries was noted.
In the physical exam, the general appearance was normal. She was agitated but alert and oriented toward time, place, person, and situation. The heart and respiratory rates were 90 beats per minute and 19 breaths per minute, respectively. The temperature was 37.5°C, and the blood pressure was 140/100 mm Hg.
The abdominal examination was normal. The right lower limb neurological assessment (motor, sensory, and deep tendon reflexes) was intact. Its skin was warm with good turgor. The peripheral pulses of the right lower extremity were palpable.
The neurological assessment of the left lower leg was intact. Still, her skin was cold and cyanotic, and the peripheral pulses in the left dorsalis pedis, posterior tibialis, and popliteal arteries were not palpable. There was no evidence of asymmetry, muscular hypotrophy, or atrophy in both lower limbs.
At admission time, an examination of other systems showed no abnormalities.
Lab data revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 30 mm/h and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 50 mg/L. The complete blood count test findings were mild leukocytosis and normal red blood cell and platelet numbers. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr) were normal. Lab data showed no evidence of hypercoagulability, hyperlipidemia, or hepatorenal dysfunction. The Doppler ultrasound scan showed a monophasic waveform in the left superficial femoral artery. There was no flow in the anterior tibialis, peroneal, or posterior tibialis arteries (). Upon further questioning, she reported limitations to activities such as running or prolonged walking due to fatigue from 6 months ago.
A CT angiogram was recommended due to the patient's physical exam and Doppler ultrasound. The CT angiogram showed a normal diameter and opacification of the left common iliac artery and its internal branches. Evidence of complete thrombosis of the external iliac artery (EIA) and common femoral artery (CFA) was noted. The superficial femoral artery (SFA) had decreased luminal diameter without thrombosis. The anterior tibialis, peroneal, and posterior tibialis arteries had filiform enhancement in the proximal part and were not opacified in other parts. The deep femoral artery (DFA) and popliteal artery were normal ().
Incidentally, on the opposite side, the normal-appearing right common iliac artery ended abruptly at the point where the right external iliac artery would be expected to originate ( and ). The proximal portion of the right external iliac artery lumen was not visualized, and there was no evidence of chronic thrombosis at the site of the right EIA (). The right CFA was opacified via multiple extraperitoneal and abdominal wall collateral vessels ().
Due to acute thrombosis of the left CFA, surgical embolectomy was considered. She was discharged without any obvious issues. One month later, follow-up showed no side effects at the surgical site, the cyanosis of the left limb disappeared, and pulses were detected.

109395,9331163-1,35911885,oa_comm/PMC009xxxxxx/PMC9331163.xml,Extended Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy for Post-stroke Depression in a Patient With a Pre-frontal Cortical Lesion: A Case Study,"A 71-year-old male participated in a research study that delivered 2 weeks of rTMS to the left DLPFC as a treatment for post-stroke depression. The study protocol was approved by the University of South Australia Human Research Ethics Committee (200697, approval date 7/2/2018). The patient had a history of left hemispheric ischemic stroke 4 years prior, with depression onset reported within 12 months of stroke. He stated that he did not believe he was depressed prior to the stroke. At time of testing, his daily medication schedule included 50 mg Atenolol, 20 mg Rivaroxaban, 20 mg Paroxetine, 10 mg Atorvastatin, and 80 mg Ezetimibe. Medications were stable for 6 months prior to study enrolment and remained stable throughout. On presentation, the patient had notable non-fluent aphasia that appeared more pronounced in the afternoon, or with fatigue. There was minimal upper-limb impairment, scoring 65/66 for the Fugl-Meyer assessment, and a high level of upper-limb function, scoring 57/57 for the Action Research Arm Test. He was an independent community ambulator, requiring no gait aids and was rated a 5 on the Functional Ambulation Category, and had high self-efficacy, scoring 113 on the Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (range 0–130).
T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences were obtained prior to rTMS treatments with a Siemens 3T MAGNETOM Skyra scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 64-channel head coil. The T1 MPRAGE protocol was 1 × 1 × 1 mm voxels, repetition time = 2,300 ms, echo time = 2.98 ms, and flip angle = 9°. FLAIR images were obtained as 1 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm voxels, repetition time = 5,000 and echo time = 393 m. Image processing was performed in FSL (FMRIB Software Library, Oxford, UK). T1 images were linearly co-registered to FLAIR images and lesion masks were manually traced by an experienced investigator and lesion volume determined. Structural images were non-linearly transformed to standard space and lesion location confirmed using the Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas within FSL.
The lesion was predominantly located in the left middle frontal gyrus with extension into the inferior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus. Anatomically, the DLPFC is thought to lie within the middle frontal gyrus, within Brodmann's area 9 and 46 (). Therefore, it appeared likely that the lesion overlapped to some extent the left DLPFC. Lesion volume was 43.0 cm3 and did not overlap with the corticospinal tract, suggestive of intact descending motor pathways (see ).
The patient was screened for brain stimulation and deemed safe (), then participated in a two-week (10 session) daily treatment course of high frequency rTMS to the left DLPFC. Simulation was delivered using a Neuro-MS/D rTMS device (Neurosoft Ltd. Ivanova, Russia) that was connected to an oil cooled figure 8 coil (wing diameter 70 mm) and delivered biphasic TMS pulses. Initially, resting motor threshold was determined by an automated algorithm within the Neuro-MS software (Neurosoft Ltd. Ivanova, Russia) that identified the minimum stimulus intensity required to evoke a motor evoked potential in the relaxed first dorsal interosseous with a peak-to-peak amplitude larger than 50 μV in at least 5 out of 10 trials (pulse frequency 0.2 Hz, surface EMG 22 × 34 mm, FIAB, Florence, Italy). Resting motor threshold was determined as 31% of maximal stimulator output. All subsequent treatment sessions were delivered to the left DLPFC, located using the Beam method to identify F3 based on the 10–20 system (), at 110% of resting motor threshold (34% maximal stimulator output). For each treatment, 3,000 pulses were delivered at 10 Hz (4 s on and 26 s off; total duration 37.5 min). We have previously found this protocol to be safe, with few side effects, when delivered to people with stroke of similar age (, ).
Therapeutic response to left DLPFC rTMS was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 item scale (PHQ-9). Briefly, the BDI contains 21 items scored from 0 (symptom absent) to 3 (severe symptom), with total scores ranging from 0 to 63 (). Scores are categorized as minimal depression (0–13), mild depression (14–19), moderate depression (20–28) and severe depression (29–63). The BDI is valid and reliable as an assessment of depression severity (), with the minimal clinically important difference of a 17.5% improvement (). The PHQ-9 explores nine items that are scored on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 3 (symptom nearly every day). Scores range from 0 to 27, with 0–4 indicating no depressive symptoms, 5–9 mild symptoms, 10–14 moderate symptoms, 15–19 moderate/severe symptoms and 20–27 severe symptoms. The PHQ-9 is a valid and reliable assessment of depression (, ), with a 5-point reduction considered a clinically meaningful improvement ().
Clinical outcomes and timeline are shown in . At baseline, the outcome measures indicated that the patient was experiencing a moderate level of depression on both the BDI (score 20) and PHQ-9 (score 14). Despite this, the patient reported higher levels of self-efficacy on the Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (score 113), possibly reflecting greater confidence in functional performance due to limited motor impairments. Following 10 daily sessions of left DLPFC rTMS treatment, the patient achieved clinically meaningful reductions in depression, with both the BDI (score 4) and PHQ-9 (score 2) indicating minimal to nil symptoms. At the completion of the two-week rTMS treatment period, the patient completed an adverse events questionnaire that was adapted from Brunoni et al. (). There were no major adverse events, with the patient only reporting mild hearing problems (reported as an increased sensation of tinnitus) and mild difficulty concentrating. Both symptoms were transient and did not bother the patient.
Approximately 10 weeks after the completion of the two-week daily rTMS treatment phase, the patient contacted the research team and identified that improvements in depression were dissipating. At this point, re-assessment of BDI (score 14) and PHQ-9 (score 10) identified a slight increase in depressive symptoms, indicative of mild-moderate levels of depression. Given previous benefits from rTMS and that the treatment was well tolerated, it was agreed to offer the patient a maintenance rTMS program that comprised weekly rTMS sessions. Maintenance rTMS was initiated at 11 weeks following the initial rTMS treatment phase, with resting motor threshold again identified as 31% of maximal stimulator output, and an identical stimulation protocol delivered. Ten weekly rTMS sessions were delivered over an 11-week period (one session missed due to patient availability). The patient verbally reported that the maintenance treatments were helping, and this was confirmed with the BDI (score 10) and PHQ-9 (score 4) that indicated depressive symptoms had reduced to a minimal/nil level. Given this progress, the patient agreed to stop treatments. No additional adverse events were noted beyond the previously reported transient hearing and concentration symptoms identified following prior rTMS treatment. At 3 months following the maintenance phase, the research team contacted the patient to ascertain whether clinical gains had been maintained. The patient reported minimal-mild symptoms of the BDI (score 11) and PHQ-9 (score 8), with scores still indicative of a clinically meaningful improvement from Baseline.","[[71.0, 'year']]",M,2022-07-14,heart,"Extended Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy for Post-stroke Depression in a Patient With a Pre-frontal Cortical Lesion: A Case Study A 71-year-old male participated in a research study that delivered 2 weeks of rTMS to the left DLPFC as a treatment for post-stroke depression.

Pain was aggravated with meals and relieved with fasting. On examination, her blood pressure was 160/92 mm Hg in right arm and 158/90 in left arm; lower limb blood pressure was 126/80 in right lower limb and 128/82 in left lower limb. Pulse rate was 90 per minute, regular, good volume with no radiofemoral delay. A renal bruit was heard on the left side. Rest of the systemic examination was within normal limits. Complete blood count, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and urine routine microscopy were within normal limits. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was raised to 35 mm/hour and C-reactive protein (CRP) was more than 5 mg/L. Her chest X-ray and electrocardiogram (ECG) were normal. Her fundus examination was normal. Serology for HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) were negative. Complement levels were normal. Ultrasonography (USG) of the abdomen was normal. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax and abdomen was done, which revealed thickening of the descending aorta upto bilateral renal artery origin with thickening of the superior mesenteric artery. CT angiography was done, and it revealed wall thickening of the descending aorta with narrowing of lumen. There was also thickening of the superior mesenteric artery with narrowing of lumen. Pulmonary trunk and bilateral pulmonary arteries were also normal. There was evidence of a heterogeneous, hyperdense region in the left medial basal segment deriving its arterial supply separately from the aorta.

The patient, a former civil servant, with 16 years of education was in good general health 7 years before his referral to our team. At that time, he started to exhibit memory and executive function disorders, after experiencing severe psychological stress. He became increasingly irritable and started to repeat the same questions. He was depressed and suicidal most of the time; he once attempted to commit suicide. Aggressiveness, agitation, delusions and illusions developed later on. He was hospitalized for 5 months in a psychiatric clinic. After discharge, orientation disorders and confusion developed. He was prescribed with antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics and cholinesterase inhibitors. However, he noticed no improvement; rather, he suffered from drug adverse events. Since then, he has been repeatedly hospitalized for acute cholecystitis-pancreatitis, surgical treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, and two strokes. Hypothyroidism was diagnosed and treated with thyrohormone per os. He developed pressure ulcers in the sacrococcygeal region, for which he had undergone surgical rehabilitation. Since August 2006, the patient is bedridden. In July 2007, the patient was referred to our team.
On examination, the patient was bedridden, cahectic, with pale conjunctivae. He was alert and sufficiently communicating but looked chronically ill, in no acute distress. On neurological examination, he was oriented in place and self but not in time and his speech was sometimes dysarthric. Examination of cranial nerves, sensory and cerebellar function revealed no abnormalities.

129420,10226795-1,37256042,oa_comm/PMC010xxxxxx/PMC10226795.xml,Free Tissue Transfer in Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report and Systematic Review,"A 29-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department with right lower extremity swelling and a large, infected wound over the right face and scalp (
). Two months prior to presentation, he was pushed onto a subway live rail, suffering an electrical burn to the right face and scalp. He was admitted to an outside hospital, underwent excisional debridement and placement of Integra bilayer matrix wound dressing (Integra LifeSciences, Princeton, NJ), then left against medical advice, and was lost to follow-up. Past medical history was notable for SCD on hydroxyurea with prior episodes of vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholecystitis status post-cholecystectomy, and chronic pain with opioid dependence. His state was further complicated by a complex social history including drug abuse and unstable housing.
The patient was admitted to our institution's Burn and Complex Wound Center. Notable admission laboratory findings included hemoglobin (Hgb) 7.8 g/dL and HbS 7.0%. Although his HbS value was unusually low, most likely due to receiving blood transfusions during recent admissions at outside hospitals, the patient's HbS 1 year prior was 55.3% which is more consistent with SCD. Venous duplex imaging demonstrated a partially occlusive DVT of the gastrocnemius vein corresponding to his right lower extremity swelling and pain. Hematology was consulted and recommended packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion with goal Hgb > 10 g/dL, exchange transfusion as needed to keep HbS < 30%, and 3 months of anticoagulation for the DVT. The patient was transfused 2 units of pRBCs to bring his Hgb to 10.0. As the HbS was 7.0%, no exchange transfusion was performed, and a therapeutic heparin drip was initiated for anticoagulation.
One day after admission, the patient underwent excisional debridement of the face and scalp wounds and right orbital exenteration, resulting in a large defect with exposed craniomaxillofacial bones (
). Intraoperative quantitative tissue cultures grew multiple drug resistant organisms including
Escherichia coli
,
Bacillus
, coagulase negative
Staphylococcus
,
Corynebacterium amycolatum
, and
Candida
which were treated with topical antimicrobials and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics per Infectious Disease recommendations.
One week after debridement, the patient underwent definitive wound closure with a left anterolateral thigh (ALT) free flap (
). Repeat HbS prior to reconstruction was 6.6%. The flap pedicle was anastomosed to the right superior thyroid artery and vein in end-to-end fashion. Technical issues requiring multiple revisions of the arterial anastomosis led to a total ischemia time of 133 minutes. Due to prolonged ischemia time, topical ice was used to cool the flap. Total operative time was 12 hours. Patient temperature was maintained between 36.1 and 38.1°C. He was transfused with 4 units of pRBCs and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma to maintain Hgb > 10 g/dL intraoperatively. The flap was monitored using a continuous implantable Doppler on the flap artery (Cook-Swartz Doppler Probe, Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN), continuous tissue oximetry monitoring (ViOptix, Newark, CA), cutaneous Doppler signals, and hourly clinical flap checks.
On postoperative day 1, the patient developed progressive neck swelling at the site of the anastomosis, flap swelling causing dehiscence at the left upper eyelid suture line, and downtrending ViOptix readings (
). Operative exploration found old hematoma in the neck and under the flap but no active bleeding. The flap was unable to be reclosed due to swelling, so it was re-inset to allow for left upper eyelid closure, leaving a small part of the left upper scalp open (
). The hematoma was attributed to postoperative hypertension and supratherapeutic heparin drip (partial thromboplastin time > 100 seconds).
The remaining hospital course was unremarkable from a flap perspective. The patient was transfused as needed to maintain Hgb > 10 g/dL. Postoperative HbS was < 5.0%. Anticoagulation consisted of aspirin 81 mg daily for empiric free flap thromboprophylaxis and apixaban 5 mg twice daily for 3 months for the right lower extremity DVT. There were no SCD-related complications. At 1-month follow-up, the flap remained viable and the left scalp wound was healing well with silver sulfadiazine dressing changes (
).
As depicted in
, we identified 83 articles, 26 of which were unique and 57 of which were duplicates. We believe the smaller number of unique articles and larger number of duplicates reflect the paucity of reports on this topic. It also likely reflects that each database encompasses a vast majority of the available literature, leading to considerable overlap. Two additional papers were found outside of the literature search from references within these 26 identified articles. Of the total of 28 articles, 7 articles described 13 cases of free tissue transfer in 10 patients with SCD.
Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative details of each case are summarized in
,
,
respectively. Seven articles describing free tissue transfer in SCT were excluded from analysis but reviewed in the “Discussion” section.
Patient ages ranged from 19 to 38 years old (average 30.7 years), with five males and five females. All cases had preoperative exchange transfusions. Goal HbS was < 30%, except for one case where it was 33.8% and one where it was not reported. All cases had a Hgb transfusion goal of > 10 g/dL, except for four cases where it was not reported (
).
Free tissue transfer was indicated for lower extremity wounds (
n
 = 11), chronic mandibular osteomyelitis (
n
 = 1), and penile autoamputation secondary to recurrent ischemic priapism (
n
 = 1). Free flaps included latissimus dorsi (
n
 = 4), hemi omentum (
n
 = 4), radial forearm (
n
 = 3), temporoparietal fascia (
n
 = 1), and gracilis (
n
 = 1). Ischemia time ranged from 16 to 150 minutes (average 72 minutes) and was not reported for four cases. Total operative time ranged from 7 to 12 hours (average 10.1 hours) and was not reported for seven cases. Four flaps were flushed with a 200-mL solution consisting of 5,000 units of heparin and dextran 40 solution prior to anastomosis. Five cases reported systemic anticoagulation prior to anastomosis, four cases gave intravenous dextran 40 and enteral aspirin, and one case gave a bolus of intravenous heparin 5,000 units (
).
The most common postoperative complications were flap compromise in three flaps and superficial wound infection in five flaps. These cases of superficial wound infection resulted in partial skin graft loss requiring repeat skin grafting in delayed fashion. However, no cases of superficial wound infection led to flap loss. Flap compromise was caused by arterial thrombosis in two cases and intraflap microvascular thrombosis in one case. Postoperative anticoagulation trends were variable. Four cases used intravenous dextran 40 for 5 days and aspirin 325 mg daily for 2 weeks. One case reported the use of aspirin for 2 weeks but did not specify the dose. Two cases did not use anticoagulation until signs of flap compromise. Ten out of 13 flaps required further operative intervention with flap exploration (
n
 = 3), flap debridement (
n
 = 3), repeat skin grafting (
n
 = 9), and penile prosthesis revision (
n
 = 1). Ten cases reported complete flap survival, one reported survival of more than two-thirds of the flap, and two reported loss of more than half of the flap. However, all defects were successfully closed with follow-up of 8 to 60 months (
).
Flap compromise occurred in cases 7, 10, and 11. In case 7, flap compromise was noted 9 hours postoperatively with decreased cutaneous Doppler signal and poor flap bleeding after a transient hypothermic and hypotensive episode.
Operative exploration showed patent pedicle vessels, and flap compromise was attributed to microvascular thrombi in the flap circulation. The flap was managed expectantly with two further debridements removing 75% of the flap thickness, but the wound was successfully closed with skin grafting. No information on postoperative Hgb, HbS, or anticoagulation was reported.
Flap compromise in case 10 was noted on postoperative day 3 with a pale flap appearance.
Operative exploration showed extensive thrombus in the posterior tibial artery, starting in the proximal lower leg and extending into the flap. Flap salvage was attempted with Fogarty catheter thrombectomies, a bolus of intravenous heparin 5,000 units, revision of the arterial anastomosis from end-to-side to end-to-end, and flap infusion of 35,000 units of streptokinase for 1 hour. Ischemia time was 6 hours and most of the flap demarcated. Interestingly, histology of the debrided flap showed thrombus without sickled cells, and HbS at the time of flap compromise was 16.6%. The wound was successfully closed with skin grafting.
Flap compromise in case 11 was noted on postoperative day 2 with decreased flap temperature.
Operative exploration showed thrombus at the arterial anastomosis extending into the flap. Flap salvage was successful with flap infusion of streptokinase and anastomosis revision from end-to-end to the dorsalis pedis artery to end-to-side to the anterior tibial artery. Ischemia time was 4 hours. Systemic anticoagulation was also instituted with intravenous heparin and aspirin for 10 days. Postoperative HbS was not reported.","[[29.0, 'year']]",M,2023-05-29,heart,"Free Tissue Transfer in Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report and Systematic Review A 29-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department with right lower extremity swelling and a large, infected wound over the right face and scalp (

According to the patient’s medical history he was followed up with PsA diagnosed until the year 2010 ().
The patient was treated with methotrexate (MTX) during the years 2010–2012 and thereafter with etanercept for his active psoriatic arthritis. In 2013 the etanercept was stopped because of secondary inefficacy and ustekinumab was started.
Two years later during ustekinumab treatment, the patient was admitted to the Hematology Outpatient Clinic because of complaints of fatigue, skin lesions, weight loss and abnormal findings of the blood tests.
On physical examination, skin lesions compatible with psoriasis were seen. The spleen and liver were not palpable. Auscultation revealed normal lung sounds, and a regular cardiac rhythm, with no murmurs.
Laboratory test results were as follows: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 45 mm/h, C-reactive protein (CRP): 12 mg/dl (normal range 0–5 mg/dl), leukocyte: 13 700/µl, lymphocyte: 6700/µl, Hb: 13.5 g/dl, Htc: 39.5%, Plt: 285,000/µl. Urinalysis, liver and kidney function tests were normal, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 183 U/l (normal range 1–140 U/l).
Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy showed leukocytosis, with lymphocytes at a rate of 67%, where the majority were small and mature and some were of medium size.
Erythrocytes were normochromic normocytic and platelets were adequate in number, with normal distribution. Flow cytometric analysis was positive for CD5, CD19, CD20 and CD5+, CD19, which was consistent with stage 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Ustekinumab-related CLL was suspected and ustekinumab treatment was discontinued and low-dose corticosteroid and MTX was started for his PsA. The patient’s symptoms regressed; the fatigue and skin lesions disappeared almost totally.

She reported normal fetal movements and had no vaginal bleeding or fluid loss. She previously experienced one uncomplicated vaginal birth at term and had no significant medical conditions. She was not taking any medications and had no history of smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. She had no known family history of ovarian, breast, or uterine malignancy. On examination, she had a large palpable firm abdominal mass in the left upper quadrant extending to the epigastric region, displacing the uterus to the far right of her abdomen. Fetal cardiotocography was within normal limits.
Urgent transvaginal and abdominal ultrasounds were performed, demonstrating a large heterogeneous solid-appearing structure with internal vascularity superior to the uterus measuring 22.3 x 17.7 x 12.6 cm. The ovaries were not visualized and there was approximately 2 liters of intraperitoneal fluid identified. Pathology results showed that her CA 125 level was 944 U/mL (normal range: <35.0 U/mL), lactate dehydrogenase was 1120 U/L (normal range: <234 U/L), C-reactive protein was 170 mg/L (normal range: <5 mg/L), and her serum calcium was within normal limits.
The patient was immediately transferred to a tertiary-level center for abdominal and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and surgical planning. MRI demonstrated a 26-cm left-sided abdominal mass with the left gonadal vein and ovarian pedicle traced into the mass with no residual normal left ovary identified​. Additionally, there were suspicious left para-aortic lymph nodes up to the level of the left renal vein, moderate ascites, and small bilateral pleural effusions identified. No bony abnormalities or omental caking were appreciated (Figures , ).
In the context of elevated tumor marker CA 125 and the MRI findings, a late-stage primary ovarian malignancy was suspected. Therefore, in discussion with the patient and her family, elective surgical management was scheduled for one week later when the patient would be at 33 weeks gestation, performed by gynecological oncology specialists in collaboration with obstetric specialists. At that time, the patient opted against more aggressive surgery, prioritizing a quicker recovery for her newborn and choosing to await histopathology results. She underwent a cesarean section, left salpingo-oophorectomy, and omental biopsies. Histopathological evaluation of the tissue samples demonstrated a high-grade BRG1-deficient malignancy consistent with SCCOHT, with fallopian tube and omental involvement confirmed. She was diagnosed with FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage III malignancy, for which genetic counseling and palliative chemotherapy were recommended. She accepted these recommendations and is currently undergoing this follow-up management.

One month later, computer tomography (CT) showed bilateral pleural effusions and she was moved to our university hospital. Routine physical examination revealed a 1.5-cm diameter, round mass in the upper outer quadrant of her right breast. A heterogenic mass was seen on ultrasonography (Fig. b), but nothing was seen on a diagnostic mammogram (Fig. a). Her medical history included a 15-year history of hypertension, well controlled with medication. Results of a staging chest X-ray film, a complete blood count, and liver function tests were normal, except for a high IL-2R of 1803 U/ml. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 2.2-cm diameter mass in the right breast, showing a malignant imaging pattern in dynamic study, but no metastasis in the bilateral axillary lymph nodes (Fig. ). Scintigraphy also showed increased gallium uptake in the left submandibular gland. Subsequent ultrasound-guided biopsy demonstrated atypical lymphocytes containing medium to large round nucleoli. Histologic analysis of the biopsy specimen was consistent with a peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified and microscopic pathology revealed atypical lymphocytes containing medium to large round nucleoli and irregular nuclear shapes (Fig. a). Immunohistochemistry revealed CD2(+), CD3(+) (Fig. b), CD4(+), CD5(−), CD7(+), CD8(−), CD20(−) (Fig. c), CD25(−), CD30(+), CD56(−), bcl-2(−), EBV-ISH(−), TIA-I(−), and ATLA negative. Simultaneously, a 2.5-cm diameter mass was found in the left mandibular area. Fine needle aspiration was performed by an otolaryngologist and cytological examination revealed a malignant lymphoma with the features of PTCL-NOS. Although there was no evidence of metastasis in specimens of bone marrow biopsy, the cytology of the pleural effusion had shown the same involvement of malignant lymphoma. Even without associated lymph node involvement, we diagnosed Stage IV PTCL-NOS with three extralymphatic organs; namely the breast, mandibular gland, and pleural effusion, prior to the chemotherapy. On re-evaluating her initial breast MRI, the CT scan had shown the breast mass progressing rapidly with a significant increase in tumor size and in the pleural effusions (Fig. a) before treatment.
Based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the patient was given systemic chemotherapy using the standard CHOP regimen (cyclophosphamide: 750 mg/m2; doxorubicin: 50 mg/m2; vincristine: 1.4 mg/m2; prednisone: 40 mg/m2) instead of surgical treatment. Six cycles of CHOP were administered at 21-day intervals over 4 months by the hematologist as follows: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine were given intravenously on day 1, with prednisone given orally 30 min prior to chemotherapy on day 1, then every 24 h on days 2–5.
CT scan showed a significant remission of the breast mass and pleural effusion in nearly complete response (Fig. b). However, the patient suffered some serious adverse effects during the chemotherapy, including grade 2 nausea, vomiting, and constipation, grade 3 neutropenia, and grade 2 heart disorder with palpitations and shortness of breath. Despite a dramatic response being achieved 6 months after beginning the CHOP therapy, it was discontinued because of heart failure, as recommended by the cardiologist. The disease relapsed in the third month after interrupting the CHOP, with a significant increase in the white blood cell count; however, no breast lump was detected at her last visit to the hospital.

He was hospitalized in a rural health facility where his clinical picture was initially considered as due to prolonged seizure activity for which he received multiple anti-epileptic drugs. As he was progressively deteriorating, he was referred to a tertiary center. As per the caregiver’s description and medical records received from the previous hospital, he was having abnormal, involuntary, rapid, brief and jerky movements involving face and upper limbs (predominantly right sided). Although there was no history of headache, fever, vomiting, and any focal weakness, the patient had significant involuntary weight loss in last 4 months. Family history and drug history were non-contributory.
Clinical examination revealed the patient was drowsy, dehydrated, cachectic, afebrile, tachycardic (130/min), normotensive (100/60 mmHg) and tachypneic (36/min). He had faciobrachial myoclonic jerks with asymmetric involvement of right upper limb more than left upper limb (distal more than proximal), with tonic neck deviation to left side withoutany abnormal movement of bilateral lower limbs (). The myoclonic jerks were not associated with any external cues or voluntary action. The tone and deep tendon reflexes of upper limbs could not be assessed due to persistent abnormal involuntary movements. The tone and deep tendon reflexes of lower limbs were normal; the plantar reflexes were flexor. Complete assessment of cranial nerves, sensory, cerebellar and autonomic functions could not be done. There was no sign of meningeal irritation and papilledema.
Acute onset multifocal myoclonus associated with encephalopathy with a background of addiction and recent onset progressive involuntary weight loss had narrowed the differential diagnoses to toxic-metabolic and neuro-infectious etiologies. Bedside CBG was measured immediately and was found to be 695 mg/dL (normal, <200). Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis revealed metabolic acidosis (pH- 7.28 [normal, 7.35–7.45], HCO3- -18 mEq/L [normal, 22–26], Na+- 117 mEq/L [normal, 135–145] [131 mEq/L when corrected for hyperglycemia], anion gap- 18 mmol/L (normal<12), with normal serum osmolality, pO2, pCO2, K+, and ionic Ca2+). Urine examination showed glycosuria (3+) and ketonuria (2+); plasma beta-hydroxy-butyrate level was found to be 3.6mmol/L (normal, <1.5). Thus, a diagnosis of DKA was confirmed. Adequate hydration was ensured with normal saline followed by treatment with continuous intravenous regular insulin (at a rate of 8 IU/h)., Once CBG came down to less than 400 mg/dL, approximately 3 h after therapy, all movements disappeared. His metabolic derangements were completely corrected by next 2 days and CBG was fairly controlled with basal-bolus regimen.
After stabilization he had absolutely normal hemodynamic and hydration status. Detailed neurological and other systemic examinations were within normal limits. His HbA1c was 10.62% (normal, <5.6), fasting and post-prandial blood glucose were 137 mg/dL (normal, <100) and 250 mg/dL (normal, <140) respectively. C peptide level was low [0.1 ng/ml (normal, 0.5–2.7)] with positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-65 antibodies that established the diagnosis of T1DM. The patient’s oropharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2, by qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction assay, was negative.
All other tests of the metabolic panel (complete hemogram, lipid profile, renal, liver, thyroid function tests) were within normal limits. Autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis profile [anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-thyroid antibodies, antibodies against leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (anti-LGl1), contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2), and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R)] were negative. Serological tests for HIV 1&2, and hepatitis B and C were negative. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal electroencephalogram (EEG), and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were normal. The rest of his hospital stay was uneventful and did not have any recurrence of involuntary movements during a 2-month follow-up.","[[36.0, 'year']]",M,2021-03-02,liver,"Faciobrachial Myoclonus as the Presenting Manifestation of Diabetic Keto-Acidosis A 36-year-old previously healthy man presented to the emergency room with acute onset abnormal movements involving face and upper limbs for 10 days and gradually developing altered sensorium for last 6 hours.

He also had a history of weight loss and an intermittent low-grade fever during the previous 6 months.
On examination, the patient was pale, conscious, alert, and oriented with a pulse of 72 beats per minute and blood pressure at 140/90 mmHg. Nothing unusual was found on examination of the chest and cardiovascular systems. Abdominal examination revealed mild hepatomegaly without splenomegaly. Examination of the nervous system showed normal mental status (patient was conscious and well oriented in time, place, and person). Sensations were diminished below the knees in both lower limbs. Power in all of the muscles was 4/5. Fundoscopy revealed a grade 4 hypertensive retinopathy.
Investigations revealed pancytopenia and normocytic normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin of 6.8 g/dL; a total leukocyte count of 1.5×103/mm3; a differential leukocyte count with 23% neutrophils, 71% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils; a platelet count of 21,000/mm3; and a markedly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 140 mm/hr. Biochemical investigations provided the following results: blood sugar, 92 g/dL; total bilirubin, 0.6 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase/aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase, 126/74/55 IU/mL; blood urea, 74 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 1.7 mg/dL; and serum uric acid, 11 mg/dL. The serum protein level was 10.0 g/dL, albumin level was 1.76 g/dL, and the albumin/globulin ratio was 0.2 (reference range, 0.9-2.0). Serum calcium levels ranged from 8.4 to 9.2 mg/dL on different occasions. The venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL), antinuclear antibody, and rheumatoid factor tests were negative, while C-reactive protein was raised. The Coombs test and the test for cold agglutinins were also negative. In addition, the serological markers for hepatitis B and hepatitis C were negative. The skull radiograph revealed multiple lytic lesions.
The chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly with prominent bronchovascular markings. Ultrasonography revealed mild hepatomegaly (15.5 cm in size), while the spleen and both kidneys were within normal limits. The wall of the rectum and sigmoid colon demonstrated thickening. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) revealed atrophy of the brain and multiple lytic lesions in the skull. The rectal wall was also edematous. There was mild hepatomegaly with the presence of minimal ascites. A clinical diagnosis of multiple myeloma was considered due to the presence of lytic bony lesions, increased total protein values, decreased serum albumin, and low albumin to globulin ratio.
Bone marrow aspiration, bone marrow biopsy, and serum protein electrophoresis were simultaneously performed to confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Bone marrow imprint smears were hypercellular with the presence of numerous bare nuclei, which were predominantly lymphoid cells with a few plasmacytoid cells (). The bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypercellular marrow with diffuse infiltration of a spectrum of lymphoid cells that were predominantly small lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, a few plasma cells, and mast cells (). The erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic series were markedly suppressed. Therefore, a diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma was considered. Immunohistochemical staining revealed 2 populations of cells; the predominant population was strongly positive for CD20 (lymphocytic cells) ( inset) while the other population was positive for CD138 (plasmacytic cells). CD5 and CD23 were negative, which ruled out chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. The serum protein electrophoresis revealed the following: total protein, 10.5 g/dL (range, 6.4-8.1); albumin, 1.76 g/dL (range, 3.50-5.64); gamma globulin, 7.18 g/dL (range, 0.62-1.53); and albumin to globulin ratio, 0.2 (range, 0.9-2.0), with an M spike of 5.98 g/dL.

The patient was an 18-year-old, 63.8-kg previously healthy male who presented for posterior spinal fusion (T7 - 12) for correction of AIS. He was first evaluated for AIS 4 months prior to surgery at which point posterior spinal fusion was recommended due to the severity of the curve. He denied systemic signs or symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated severe scoliosis (62°) S-shaped rotary scoliosis with the dextro-scoliotic apex at T7 - 8 and the levo-scoliotic apex at L1 - 2. There was no evidence of intraspinal pathology and no canal or foraminal stenosis.
On the day of the procedure, the patient was held nil per os for 6 h. Preoperative vitals were normal with the patient being afebrile with a normal heart rate and blood pressure (BP) of 132/57 mm Hg. Preoperative laboratory analyses, obtained 2 weeks prior to surgery, were normal (sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.96 mg/dL). The patient was transported to the operating room and standard American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were placed. After the inhalation of 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen, a peripheral intravenous cannula was placed. Anesthesia was induced with propofol (150 mg), sufentanil (30 µg), lidocaine (60 mg), ketamine (30 mg), and methadone (7.1 mg). Neuromuscular blockade was achieved with rocuronium (40 mg) to facilitate direct laryngoscopy with a Macintosh 3 laryngoscope and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube. A radial arterial cannula and a second peripheral intravenous cannula were placed. Maintenance anesthesia included desflurane (titrated to maintain the bispectral index at 50 - 60), sufentanil infusion (0.1 - 0.5 µg/kg/h), lidocaine 30 (µg/kg/min), ketamine (0.25 mg/kg/h), and esmolol 5 - 35 (µg/kg/h). A tranexamic acid infusion (50 mg/kg bolus followed by 5 mg/kg/h) and intraoperative cell saver were used to limit the need for allogeneic blood products. Intravenous fluids were provided using Normosol®. Arterial blood gases, electrolytes, and hemoglobin were analyzed at regular intervals during the course of the procedure using point-of-care testing (POCT). The initial POCT at 8:56 am showed a normal pH 7.37, sodium 140 mEq/L, hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL and potassium of 3.9 mEq/L. The surgical procedure proceeded uneventfully without excessive blood loss (total estimated blood loss for the case was 200 mL) or hemodynamic instability. Report POCT testing performed at 10:24 am was remarkable for an increase of the potassium level to 5.3 mEq/L (). No change in the electrocardiogram (ECG) was noted. Given the unexplained increase in the serum potassium, the minute ventilation was increased by approximately 20% and a repeat serum potassium was obtained in 1 h. At 11:22 am, the serum potassium was 5.9 mEq/L. At this point, the esmolol infusion was discontinued, the Normosol® was discontinued and 0.9% normal saline was used for intraoperative fluid replacement. Sodium bicarbonate (50 mEq) was administered to treat a base deficit of -3 and furosemide (10 mg) administered intravenously. The furosemide resulted in an increase in urine output to 100 - 250 mL/h over the next 2 - 3 h. Due to the concern for an occult myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, the inhalational anesthetic agent was discontinued and total intravenous anesthesia with a propofol infusion (75 - 100 µg/kg/min) titrated to maintain the bispectral index at 50 - 60 []. Throughout this time, no change in the ECG was noted. Pharmacy was contacted to verify there had been no inadvertent use of concentrated potassium solutions to mix the intraoperative infusions. No high potassium concentration solutions are available in the operating room pharmacy. Dissection of the paraspinal muscles and exposure of the spine was completed at 10:45 am. POCT at 11:46 am showed that the potassium had decreased to 5.7 mEq/L, and then to 4.7 mEq/L at 1:09 pm. At the conclusion of the surgical procedure, the patient’s trachea was extubated, and he was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. On postoperative day 1, the serum potassium was 3.6 mEq/L. Creatinine phosphokinase was mildly elevated at 848 U/L (range of 36 - 289 U/L), which was attributed to the surgical dissection.

Dyspnea, nausea, and back pain were not reported. She was taking escitalopram 5 mg as needed and had no family history of GBC. On physical examination, her abdomen was soft, flat, and scar-free. Electrocardiogram (ECG) did not show ST segment changes. On blood examination, her cardiac enzyme, white blood cell, and C-reactive protein levels were not elevated; however, her hemoglobin level was low (6.4 g/dL). Computed tomography (CT) revealed a tense gallbladder with a heterogeneous, high-density area (a) with no evidence of pleurisy or aortic dissection. Contrast-enhanced CT showed no obvious contrast extravasation in the gallbladder or obvious mass lesions. Increased pericholecystic attenuation on arterial-phase CT was confirmed, which indicated the possibility of acute cholecystitis (b). Due to the risk of acute cholecystitis and gallbladder perforation, we performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy without lymphadenectomy. Operative findings did not reveal any evidence of malignancy in the gallbladder serosa. Congestive findings were noted from the body to the fundus of the gallbladder ().

Dyspnea, nausea, and back pain were not reported. She was taking escitalopram 5 mg as needed and had no family history of GBC. On physical examination, her abdomen was soft, flat, and scar-free. Electrocardiogram (ECG) did not show ST segment changes. On blood examination, her cardiac enzyme, white blood cell, and C-reactive protein levels were not elevated; however, her hemoglobin level was low (6.4 g/dL). Computed tomography (CT) revealed a tense gallbladder with a heterogeneous, high-density area (a) with no evidence of pleurisy or aortic dissection. Contrast-enhanced CT showed no obvious contrast extravasation in the gallbladder or obvious mass lesions. Increased pericholecystic attenuation on arterial-phase CT was confirmed, which indicated the possibility of acute cholecystitis (b). Due to the risk of acute cholecystitis and gallbladder perforation, we performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy without lymphadenectomy. Operative findings did not reveal any evidence of malignancy in the gallbladder serosa. Congestive findings were noted from the body to the fundus of the gallbladder ().

He presented with progressive abdominal distension (more to the right side) of 5 months, abdominal pain for 2 months, and a 1-month history of cough. The patient started to experience dull-achy non-radiating abdominal pain with no relieving or aggravating factors 3 months after the swelling was noticed, and at the same time he was observed to have progressive weight loss associated with anorexia. The patient experienced an occasional global headache that he described as throbbing and fever with chills and rigors that were relieved by taking acetaminophen. There was no hematuria, facial or leg swelling, focal swelling in other parts of the body, or bone pain.
Physical examination revealed a chronically ill-looking wasted febrile child with a temperature of 38.5 °C. The patient was pale but not jaundiced. There was no significant peripheral lymphadenopathy, pedal edema, or visible varicocele. No obvious hemihypertrophy or aniridia was seen. His weight was 21 kg, which is 72% of the expected (underweight). The blood pressure was within normal limits for the patient's age, sex, and height. Abdominal examination revealed a mass in the right flank extending toward the midline. The mass was irregular, firm, non-tender, and slightly mobile. The liver and spleen were not enlarged on palpation, and the left kidney was not ballottable.
An abdominal CT scan showed a heterogeneous low-density mass arising from the right kidney crossing the midline to involve the opposite left kidney, and excretory phase images revealed distortion and stretching of the calyces of the part of the left kidney that was relatively spared (Fig. ). There were no intralesional calcifications. CT of the chest showed two discrete nodules in the left upper zone and right lower zone (Fig. ). Urinalysis showed microscopic hematuria (3+) and ova of Schistosoma haematobium, but urine culture was normal. Renal and liver function tests were unremarkable.
A presumptive diagnosis of stage V WT in an HK was made based on the contiguous extension of the tumor from the right kidney through the isthmus to the contralateral kidney. The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine and actinomycin D for 4 weeks and was subsequently scheduled for nephrectomy. The intraoperative finding was an HK with a tumor involving the right kidney, the isthmus, and the lower pole of the left kidney, confirming a preoperative diagnosis of stage V disease. Right nephrectomy, isthmusectomy, and left partial nephrectomy were performed (Fig. ). Grossly, the resected tumor (right kidney, isthmus, and the left kidney lower pole) was irregular and firm, measuring 19 cm × 12 cm × 9 cm. The cut surface appeared variegated, with a mixture of tan brown, grey, and black colors (Fig. a). The histology of the tumor showed a small round blue cell composed of predominantly blastemal cells with foci of epithelial and mesenchymal elements arranged in triphasic patterns invading the renal parenchyma. There was high mitotic activity with focal areas of tumor necrosis and host cellular immune response (Fig. b).
The patient’s postoperative condition was unremarkable, and he was continued on adjuvant chemotherapy before he was discharged home. The desire for the patient to have radiotherapy in addition to the chemotherapy was not feasible due to the lack of a radiotherapy facility in our hospital during the period of patient management, and unfortunately, the parents could not afford referral to another hospital.

She was 31 weeks into her second pregnancy having experienced no problems during the first or second trimester or at all during her previous pregnancy 6 years earlier. Ambulatory monitoring organised prior to her admission had demonstrated frequent unifocal premature ventricular contractions (PVC) including couplets and triplets, and short salvos of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) corresponding with symptoms. The initial physical examination, electrolytes and laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Obstetric assessment revealed a healthy fetus consistent with 31 weeks of gestation.
Her electrocardiogram during a typical episode revealed a monomorphic wide-complex tachycardia of left bundle branch block morphology consistent with an origin from the right ventricular outflow tract (). Echocardiography demonstrated a mildly dilated left ventricle with normal function and an ejection fraction of 63%. Initial attempts to control her arrhythmia medically with oral and intravenous metoprolol were unsuccessful. The patient was subsequently treated with oral verapamil therapy but, despite initial benefit, suffered with recurrent and increasingly sustained episodes of VT associated with hypotension and pre-syncope. Following obstetric consultation, the option of catheter ablation was offered as a therapeutic option. After discussion of the potential risks to the mother and foetus, both of the procedure and of potential radiation exposure, informed consent was obtained.
The patient was brought to the electrophysiology laboratory in the postabsorptive state and placed in the left lateral position using a wedge to decompress the inferior vena cava. A midwife was present to monitor the foetal heart rate. Lead shielding of the abdomen and pelvis was used to shield the fetus as much as possible if any fluoroscopic radiation was needed. Venous access was obtained from the right femoral vein. Although we intended to perform the procedure with zero fluoroscopy, owing to the distortion of the pelvic anatomy by the gravid uterus and the tilt from the wedge, minimal fluoroscopy (60 seconds, 9.9mGy) was utilised to position the catheters in the heart. Catheters were placed in the right ventricular apex and coronary sinus.
The remainder of the procedure was performed with zero-fluoroscopy using a 3-dimensional mapping system to create a geometrical shell of the right ventricular outflow tract (NavX, St. Jude Medical, St Paul, Minneapolis, USA). During frequent periods of non-sustained VT earliest endocardial activation was localised to the high outflow tract (). At this location the local electrogram on the ablation catheter preceded the onset of the QRS complex by 33ms (). Catheter tip pressure at this site induced sustained VT with subsequent radiofrequency ablation terminating VT. There was no recurrence during a 30-minute period of observation. The procedure was uncomplicated and no further PVCs or VT were observed on telemetry over the following 48-hours.

Physical examination was unremarkable except for localized abdominal tenderness at the right upper quadrant and generalized jaundice. Laboratory workup upon admission revealed total bilirubin 2.93 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin 1.69 mg/dL, and unconjugated 1.24 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 279 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 990 U/L and alkaline phosphatase (AP) of 291 U/L, GGT of 338 U/L with all other parameters within normal ranges.
The patient was transferred to the operating room to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively, dense adhesions, extensive acute, chronic inflammation, and an impacted stone were found in the Hartmann pouch, causing extrinsic compression of the common bile duct (CBD). Adequate dissection of the cystic duct was impossible to achieve, so a fenestrated partial cholecystectomy was completed. An intraoperative ERCP was performed to visualize the previously seen stenosis of the CBD (). Bipolar electrohydraulic lithotripsy with a 1.9 Fr Autolith™ (Boston Scientific; Massachusetts, USA) was performed by an attending surgeon with advanced endoscopic training, with energy levels of 12 W and a guidewire, clearing the CBD. Finally, a plastic biliary endoprosthesis was placed. The patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 2 with a final diagnosis of Mirizzi Syndrome Type I.
Two months after the first admission, the patient arrived at the emergency department once more with an identical clinical picture than the first episode. A computerized tomography (CT) scan connoted the migration of the biliary endoprosthesis.

Physical examination was unremarkable except for localized abdominal tenderness at the right upper quadrant and generalized jaundice. Laboratory workup upon admission revealed total bilirubin 2.93 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin 1.69 mg/dL, and unconjugated 1.24 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 279 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 990 U/L and alkaline phosphatase (AP) of 291 U/L, GGT of 338 U/L with all other parameters within normal ranges.
The patient was transferred to the operating room to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively, dense adhesions, extensive acute, chronic inflammation, and an impacted stone were found in the Hartmann pouch, causing extrinsic compression of the common bile duct (CBD). Adequate dissection of the cystic duct was impossible to achieve, so a fenestrated partial cholecystectomy was completed. An intraoperative ERCP was performed to visualize the previously seen stenosis of the CBD (). Bipolar electrohydraulic lithotripsy with a 1.9 Fr Autolith™ (Boston Scientific; Massachusetts, USA) was performed by an attending surgeon with advanced endoscopic training, with energy levels of 12 W and a guidewire, clearing the CBD. Finally, a plastic biliary endoprosthesis was placed. The patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 2 with a final diagnosis of Mirizzi Syndrome Type I.

Five years ago, he underwent lung resection for adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung, without recurrence to date. At the time of lung surgery, he was diagnosed with gallbladder stones and hepatolithiasis of the segment III, VI and VIII ducts (B3, B5 and B8) with corresponding ductal dilatation, suggestive of associated inflammatory stricture. Yearly imaging study follow-up for gallstone lesions until the recent last visit to emergency room showed no interval changes of gallstone disease or evidence of malignant changes.
Imaging study findings of dynamic liver computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were as follows: mucin-secreting IPNB mainly in B3 with slight interval aggravation of biliary ductal dilatation; and multiple intrahepatic duct stones, interval increased extent and gallbladder (). Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) was mildly elevated (38 U/ml). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) showed multiple filling defects in the biliary system, which was compatible with mucin-producing IPNB (). Two endoscopic nasobiliary tubes were inserted and retained for 10 days in order to mediate biliary decompression.
After laparotomy, we first opened the fully distended common bile duct (). After removing the very sticky mucin, the B3 cystic lesion identified as the source of the mucin was excised and a 2 cm-sized B3 opening was exposed (). Frozen-section biopsy revealed that the B3 cystic wall was involved with cancer, thus the whole B3 duct wall except its connecting part to the left intrahepatic duct was resected. Intrahepatic duct stones at B5 and B8 were removed with curved stone forceps. Due to some risk of residual tumor that could re-induce mucin production, we performed two separate biliary bypass drainages to the common bile duct and B3 orifice (). The operation included segment III hepatic resection, intrahepatic stone removal, end-to-side choledochojejunostomy and B3 hepaticojejunostomy.
Pathologic findings were as follows: intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with intraductal growth type; confinement to bile duct wall; no lymphovascular invasion; no perineural invasion: no involvement of B3 margin and hepatic parenchymal resection margins; biliary intraepithelial neoplasia 2 at the common bile duct wall; and chronic cholangitis with bile duct dilatation, extensive erosion, multifocal rupture and abscess and xanthogranulomatous inflammation.
The patient recovered uneventfully from surgery. Follow-up hepatobiliary scintigraphy showed uneventful biliary drainage ().

She worked at a pet shop, was not a regular user of tobacco products, drugs or alcohol, had no recent contact with people who were ill and she had not traveled in the preceding months.
Physical examination showed an oral temperature of 37°C and a pulse rate of 106 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed no murmurs. Lung auscultation was unremarkable and hepato-splenomegaly was palpable on abdominal examination. There was no lymphadenopathy or meningismus on physical examination.

Patient reported subjective fever associated with rigors and chills but denied diurnal variation, any sick contacts, uncooked/stale food consumption, recent travels, or any urinary symptoms. Her comorbid conditions included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with a recent CD4+ count of 810 cells/μL (acquired through unknown source, compliant on antiretroviral therapy), subclinical hypothyroidism, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. She had tubal ligation done 5 years ago and did not report any family history of cancers, heart, or lung diseases. She was non-smoker, non-alcoholic, and had never used recreational drugs or herbal medications. She worked as a home attendant and had 3 children, lived in United States for the past 15 years with last travel to Africa 6 years ago.
On presentation to the emergency department, patient was found to be febrile with a temperature of 38 °C (Fig. ), tachycardia of 112 beats/min, blood pressure of 125/75 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She was lethargic but alert and oriented and not in an acute distress. Cardiovascular exam was unremarkable except for tachycardia. Rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Initial laboratory findings are shown in Tables and . Patient was started on intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics for suspected acute cholangitis. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed to discern cause of sepsis, results of which were inconclusive. Advance imaging including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was negative for any intrahepatic, biliary, or pancreatic ductal pathology. She continued to have persistent fevers despite sufficient antibiotics, and all cultures remained negative. Her liver function tests normalized within 3 days, without any intervention. Extensive work up for fever including testing for legionella, mycoplasma, leptospirosis, herpes simplex, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), strongyloides, stool ova and parasites were negative.

The child subsequently walked with support and then progressively lost ability to sit or to use his limbs for activities of daily living. The patient became dependent on family members for all his activities. This was also associated with the reduction in verbal output for the same duration, which was limited to bisyllables at presentation. He was studying in 7th standard and developed declining in scholastic performance.
The patient gave a history of non-rhythmic, brief, involuntary and sudden jerks, involving upper limbs followed by lower limbs leading to dropping of objects for the past three months. This initially used to happen for four to five times a day but its frequency gradually increased and later happened once in every 10-15 seconds. These jerks used to persist in sleep. No other tonic-clonic or focal seizures were reported. There was no loss of consciousness, bladder or bowel symptoms, or visual deterioration.
He is the youngest of five siblings born out of a non-consanguineous seropositive couple with a normal birth and development history until 11 years of age. He had an exanthematous fever at 5 years of age, suggestive of measles which resolved without any immediate complications. The child was diagnosed with HIV at 9 years of age, one year after his parents were diagnosed. There was no prior history of blood transfusions or sexual abuse. The possibility of perinatally acquired infection was considered as perinatally acquired HIV infection present with symptoms only in adolescence and early adulthood as has been described in the literature. His CD4 count was 204 before initiation of ART. This child was initiated on triple-drug ART regime – Zidovudine, Nevirapine, and Lamivudine which was well tolerated. CD4 count increased to 419 before child developed neurological symptoms. Clinically, at presentation, his World Health Organization (WHO) staging for HIV virus was stage 2.
On examination, the child was conscious, alert, and oriented with normal vital parameters. There were multiple healed scars evident on his forehead and scalp, attributed to injuries sustained after dropping attacks. A cranial nerve examination, including the fundus, was unremarkable. Motor examination revealed 3/5 power in all four limbs and normal tone with normal deep tendon reflexes. No meningeal signs, involuntary movements, or cerebellar signs were evident. His gait and posture could not be tested as he was not able to stand without support.
Laboratory evaluation revealed normal complete blood counts and normal renal and liver parameters. His CD4 count was 429. Electroencephalography of monopolar montage revealed generalized pseudo-periodic discharges at an interval of nine to 12 seconds (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid cytology, glucose levels, and protein levels were normal. The measurement of specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that measles immunoglobulin G antibodies were markedly elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid at 1:625 (normal range, <1:5). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed enhancements of affected regions in the early course of the disease in T1-weighted scan. T2-weighted scans show nonspecific hyperintensities and fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences (Figure ).
Hence the clinical picture, electroencephalogram, and cerebrospinal fluid patterns were pathognomonic for a diagnosis of SSPE.
The child received sodium valproate and clonazepam, after which the frequency of the child’s drop attacks initially abated, but later increased again. Other treatment options such as interferon and Isoprinosine were not considered because of financial constraints. The patient was on follow-up for two months but did not show any significant improvement.","[[12.0, 'year']]",M,2017-06-13,liver,"Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis in a Child Suffering from Human Immunodeficiency Virus on “Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy” – Can This be Another Instance of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome? A 12-year-old boy with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnosed at 9 years of age and on ART for the last three years, presented with a history of gradual onset of rapidly progressive difficulty in ambulation for the past six months. The child subsequently walked with support and then progressively lost ability to sit or to use his limbs for activities of daily living. The patient became dependent on family members for all his activities. This was also associated with the reduction in verbal output for the same duration, which was limited to bisyllables at presentation. He was studying in 7th standard and developed declining in scholastic performance.
The patient gave a history of non-rhythmic, brief, involuntary and sudden jerks, involving upper limbs followed by lower limbs leading to dropping of objects for the past three months. This initially used to happen for four to five times a day but its frequency gradually increased and later happened once in every 10-15 seconds. These jerks used to persist in sleep. No other tonic-clonic or focal seizures were reported. There was no loss of consciousness, bladder or bowel symptoms, or visual deterioration.
He is the youngest of five siblings born out of a non-consanguineous seropositive couple with a normal birth and development history until 11 years of age. He had an exanthematous fever at 5 years of age, suggestive of measles which resolved without any immediate complications. The child was diagnosed with HIV at 9 years of age, one year after his parents were diagnosed. There was no prior history of blood transfusions or sexual abuse. The possibility of perinatally acquired infection was considered as perinatally acquired HIV infection present with symptoms only in adolescence and early adulthood as has been described in the literature. His CD4 count was 204 before initiation of ART. This child was initiated on triple-drug ART regime – Zidovudine, Nevirapine, and Lamivudine which was well tolerated.

32557,4874015-1,27213047,oa_comm/PMC004xxxxxx/PMC4874015.xml,Management of massive diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in a child with systemic lupus erythematosus,"A 14-year-old African-American female presented with sudden onset of shortness of breath and palpitations. Her past history was significant for a recent diagnosis of SLE when she had presented with complaints of rapid weight loss (9 kg over 2 months), easy fatiguability, and a malar facial rash a month back. Her laboratory evaluation was positive for fluorescent antinuclear antibody (FANA) of 1:360 (speckled pattern), a low white blood cell (WBC) count of 3,300/mm3, a low hemoglobin count of 3.3 g/dl, and urine analysis that demonstrated 2+ albumin with 2+ blood. Other pertinent labs included a positive anti-SSA of 311 RU/ml, a positive anti-SSB of 644 RU/ml, and a positive RPR of 1:8 together with a negative test for treponema pallidum. These abnormal labs together with the clinical presentation led to the diagnosis of SLE. She had been started on hydroxychloroquine and prednisone. She was seen in the emergency department (ED) on three different occasions since diagnosis for various non-specific complaints including dry cough, mild hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and syncope. She was found to be severely anemic (hemoglobin of 4.1 g/dl) and treated with blood transfusion and iron supplements. A diagnosis of right lower lobe pneumonia had been made and she was treated with oral antibiotics.
At her recent ED presentation for shortness of breath, chest x-ray showed infiltrates and effusion over the right middle and lower lobes. While in the ED, she developed worsening tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension requiring rapid intubation with a single lumen endotracheal tube (ETT). Copious bright red blood was seen upon intubation indicative of massive pulmonary hemorrhage. She was emergently taken to the catheterization laboratory to locate and potentially embolize the source of the bleeding. Selective angiography demonstrated the right bronchial artery as the source of bleeding. However, the anterior spinal artery was found to branch off the right bronchial artery, just proximal to the level of the bleeding. Hence, embolization was deferred due to the potential risk of paraplegia. During the procedure, the patient developed progressive hypoxic respiratory failure requiring escalation of support to high-frequency oscillatory ventilator (HFOV). However, despite a mean air pressure of 45 cm H2O and addition of inhaled nitric oxide, there was no improvement. Hence, she was emergently cannulated for venovenous-ECMO. Initially one double lumen cannula was placed in the right internal jugular vein; however, the venous flow was not sufficient. The other cannula was placed in the left femoral vein to achieve the target ECMO flow. The single lumen ETT was exchanged for a double lumen ETT to protect the non-bleeding lung. She was transferred to the operation room on ECMO where she underwent an emergent right upper and middle pulmonary lobectomy. During procedure, the entire right lung was noted to be densely consolidated with a hemorrhagic appearance. Microscopically, the tissue demonstrated diffuse interseptal capillary wall damage with marked neutrophil infiltration and massive intraalveolar hemorrhage, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages are present in all lobes of the right lung. Pathology diagnosis is pulmonary neutrophilic capillaritis with diffuse parenchyma hemorrhage.
Following surgery, she was transferred to the cardiac ICU where she was maintained on venovenous-ECMO and HFOV due to hypoxia and hemodynamic instability (Figure ). To avoid further bleeding, platelet was transfused to keep platelet counts >100,000/μl. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin drip for ECMO was not given at the beginning. It was started at the lower dosage to titrate the activated clotting time (ACT) between 140 and 160 s for the first 48 h after the operation, then increased to keep ACT 180–200 s. During the first week, she received high-dose methylprednisolone, 1 g daily for 3 days, which was then reduced to 60 mg every 6 h. In view of ongoing hemoptysis and potential for further pulmonary hemorrhage, she was treated with plasmapheresis while on ECMO with alternate day treatment regimens for 3 cycles. In addition, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) of 2 g/kg/dose was also administered to minimize the risk of recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage. A single dose of 750 mg of cyclophosphamide was also administered to reduce the inflammatory effects of active SLE. Although she received multiple packed red blood cell, frozen fresh plasma, and platelet transfusions during her hospital course, the requirement for blood products declined as medical treatments for SLE with plasmapheresis and IVIG were advanced. A respiratory culture of streptococcus viridans was treated with appropriate antibiotics. A chest tube was placed on day 3 for a left hemothorax. On the fifth postoperative day, bronchoscopy demonstrated clear airway without active signs of hemorrhage. The patient was transitioned to a conventional ventilator from the HFOV on post-op day 7. She was successfully decannulated from ECMO on day 10. She was extubated on day 18 and discharged home in a stable condition after 57 days of hospital stay. At the time of discharge, she was comfortably breathing room air without any neurological sequelae. Predischarge chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields.
Although there is a wide spectrum of pulmonary manifestations in SLE, pulmonary hemorrhage occurs in 5 to 10% of pediatric SLE patients with pulmonary involvement. It can present as a chronic low-grade hemorrhage with few early symptoms, but more frequently it presents as acute respiratory distress []. One type of pulmonary hemorrhage, DAH, is a rare and life-threatening complication of SLE associated with high mortality []. DAH may present in the early course of SLE in children [] and is associated with high disease activity []. Bleeding into the alveolar spaces characterizes the syndrome of DAH and is due to disruption of the alveolar-capillary basement membrane caused by injury or inflammation of the arterioles, venules, or alveolar septal (alveolar wall or interstitial) capillaries.
Thoracic surgery should be consulted early in the course of management, and emergency lung resection is a life-saving procedure if bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is unsuccessful []. With advances in interventional radiology, the number of emergent surgery for massive hemoptysis has decreased because of associated morbidity and mortality; however, surgery is indicated for technically difficult cases of BAE, respiratory or hemodynamically unstable patients for BAE, and early or repeated recurrence of hemoptysis after BAE [,]. In general, surgery was not considered as an option for patients with moderate to severe lung function impairment. However, early initiation of ECMO could improve oxygen delivery and allow to perform a life-saving surgery as seen in our case [].
ECMO was used as a rescue therapy for the severe respiratory failure in DAH secondary to SLE []. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin was initially deferred until hemostasis was achieved, despite a risk of ECMO circuit thrombosis, since ECMO can be performed without systemic anticoagulation for short periods [,]. Once hemostasis is achieved, anticoagulation therapy should be initiated to prevent the thrombosis in the ECMO circuit and oxygenation membrane. Kolovos et al. reported that eight children with respiratory failure from pulmonary hemorrhage were successfully managed with ECMO with continuous heparin drip with the target of ACT 160–180 s []. Currently the ideal target level of anticoagulation for patients with pulmonary hemorrhage in children is unknown.
These interventions would not have been successful if medical treatment against SLE was not initiated as soon as possible. The main therapy for DAH with SLE in children and adults is high-dose methylprednisolone [] combined with cyclophosphamide [] and plasmapheresis []. The other therapeutic options are rituximab, IVIG, and mycophenolate mofetil []. Plasmapheresis performed on ECMO has a benefit for sharing vascular access and has been used for severe pulmonary hemorrhage due to other autoimmune diseases []. Currently there are no therapeutic guidelines for this life-threatening manifestation of SLE due to the rarity of this condition. Multi-institutional data collection would be beneficial for determining the effectiveness of each therapeutic options for this condition.","[[14.0, 'year']]",F,2015-03-07,heart,"Management of massive diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in a child with systemic lupus erythematosus A 14-year-old African-American female presented with sudden onset of shortness of breath and palpitations.

A male patient in his late sixties, with a 40-pack-year smoking history and without any co-morbidities, presented with complaints of dry cough, shortness of breath (SOB), and right-sided chest pain for one month, along with unintentional loss of weight and appetite. The cough was insidious in onset, persistent, and not associated with any diurnal or postural variation. Shortness of breath was also of gradual onset, mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council) grade II, and was persistent. Chest pain was dull, and there were no specific aggravating or relieving factors. There were no accompanying symptoms like hemoptysis, fever, or pedal edema. Vitals were within the normal range. A general examination revealed pallor without any clubbing or lymphadenopathy. On general examination, bilateral gynecomastia was present without any discharge (Figure ). Except for reduced air entry on the right side, the respiratory examination was normal.
Investigations
The chest X-ray showed a right-sided heterogeneous opacity with lower zone infiltrates. The high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) thorax revealed an ill-defined necrotic mass lesion in the right upper lobe measuring 5.9 cm × 5.6 cm × 5.6 cm extending into the right hilum (Figure ). Mediastinal lymph nodes in the subcarinal location with mild right-sided pleural effusion were also seen (Figure ). Screening bronchoscopy revealed no endobronchial growth, and bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for routine infective workup and malignant cytology.
Differential diagnosis
A transthoracic ultrasound-guided biopsy of the right lung mass was done that was suggestive of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Figure ). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results were negative for p-40, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), Napsin A, and synaptophysin, confirming a diagnosis of NSCLC-NOS (not otherwise specified). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen, metastable Technetium 99 labeled methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) bone scan, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI) of the brain done for metastatic workup revealed no evidence of distant metastasis in these regions. However, a diagnostic pleural tap was done, and cytology revealed the presence of atypical cells, suggestive of malignant metastases. The clinical stage of lung cancer was cT3N2M1a (stage IV disease). His performance status was 4 as per the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from the right breast tissue was suggestive of gynecomastia. The urine pregnancy test (UPT) yielded a positive result. The β-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) was elevated at 639 mIU/ml (normal value <5 mIU/ml). His testicular ultrasound was normal. There was no relevant drug history and no history of hypogonadism. Furthermore, in his liver and renal function tests, serum levels of prolactin, testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and cortisol were within the normal range. So, we arrived at the diagnosis of paraneoplastic syndrome associated with lung cancer.
Treatment
After 72 hours of admission to our ward, his clinical condition deteriorated with a new-onset fever and a flare-up of cough, SOB, and chest pain. Repeat chest X-rays showed new infiltrates, suggesting hospital-acquired pneumonia. He was shifted to an intensive care unit in view of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. He was managed first on non-invasive ventilator support and then intubated due to worsening sensorium.
Outcome and follow-up
He was deemed unfit for any definitive therapy for malignancy because of the ongoing respiratory infection and poor performance status. He succumbed to his illness on day 7 of hospitalization as a result of hypoxemic respiratory failure and septicemia due to hospital-acquired pneumonia.","[[67.5, 'year']]",M,2024-02-23,liver,"A Lung Cancer Patient Presenting With Gynecomastia: An Uncommon Paraneoplastic Syndrome Case history and clinical examination

He was diagnosed as having right kidney tumor and was subsequently hospitalized in the Department of Pediatrics of the Hirosaki University Hospital. After pediatric surgeons performed a total resection of his right kidney and a histopathologic examination, he was diagnosed as having clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. After surgery, he was treated with chemotherapy, and his general condition gradually improved. However, he then exhibited general malaise and was diagnosed as having secondary AML in May 2012. Although chemotherapy treatment for the AML was once again successful, subsequent tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, intracerebral hemorrhage, and secondary renal and heart failures led to severe deterioration of his general condition.
An ultrasound examination performed by his pediatricians detected bilateral intraocular protrusions, and he was referred to our ophthalmology clinic. We were unable to measure his visual acuity at the first examination, as he had been sedated for general treatment. Subsequent fundus examinations did show intraocular protrusions, and he was diagnosed with bilateral subretinal or choroidal hemorrhages. A few weeks later, bilateral dense vitreous hemorrhages occurred, his fundi became totally obscured, and he became blind. Electroretinograms (ERG) were extinguished bilaterally, and A/B-mode ultrasonographies revealed bilateral combined vitreous hemorrhage and hemorrhagic retinal detachment (fig. ).
After intensive pediatric treatment, his general condition improved to the point where he was well enough to receive transplantation of umbilical cord blood stem cells in September 2012. Transplanted cord blood stem cells were successfully engrafted, and his general condition continued to improve. Because both his parents and the pediatricians wanted to treat his blindness with surgery, we agreed to perform vitrectomy associated with lens extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in his left eye. The left eye was chosen for the surgery as it still demonstrated a sluggish direct light reflex, while his right eye had completely lost the direct light reflex.
Although his visual acuity showed no light perception bilaterally, preoperative ocular examinations revealed that a sluggish direct light reflex remained in his left eye and that bilateral dense massive vitreous hemorrhages could still be observed (fig. ). However, ultrasonographic examinations showed that the previously detected hemorrhagic retinal detachments (fig. ) were no longer observable.
In December 2012, the patient underwent 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy combined with phacoemulsification and aspiration (PEA). We first prepared surgical ports for the 25-gauge vitrectomy and then uneventfully performed PEA before starting the vitrectomy procedure. After removal of the dense vitreous hemorrhage, we observed that the peripheral retinal color was mottled, similar to that which is seen after the complete absorption of a subretinal hemorrhage. Surprisingly, with the exception of numerous fine retinal folds, the retinal color in the posterior pole appeared almost normal, and the optic disc was not pale. Because we detected a putative perforating retinal hole in the mid-peripheral portion, laser photocoagulation was applied around the lesion. Next, an IOL was implanted in the bag, and a posterior capsulotomy was performed. We then closed all surgical incisions. No surgical complications occurred during or after the operation. Although the postoperative visual acuity remained at light perception for 3 months, it gradually started to improve 4 months postoperatively. The condition of the fundus appeared to be almost the same as that seen at the end of surgery (fig. ). An optical coherence tomography examination of the left eye indicated that while the shape of the central fovea was normal, the external limiting membrane was absent, and the inner segment ellipsoid line was extremely thin and not continuous under the fovea (fig. ). In September 2013, the corrected visual acuity in his left eye improved to 0.1.","[[4.0, 'year']]",M,2015,heart,"A Case of Childhood Vitrectomy Performed for Dense Vitreous Hemorrhage Secondary to Leukemia Therapy and Tumor Lysis Syndrome A tumorous mass at the right lateral side of the abdomen of a 4-year-old boy was detected in April 2011.

The pain was worse on standing, walking and bending over. The pain was relieved when she was recumbent. She did not have any neurological symptoms. Because of the severity of her pain, she was started on oxycodone and a back brace was applied. Prior to her operation she was receiving 10 mg of oxycodone 6 times a day. Even with the medication and the brace she still had significant pain. Her past history was negative for any serious illness except for prior compression fractures in the lumbar vertebral bodies, that were treated with vertebroplasty procedures. She was on medications for heart burns and mild dementia.
Physical examination
The patient was in significant distress due to the pain. She was alert and oriented. Cranial nerves were intact. She was slightly bent over when she walked. Her coordination and deep tendon reflexes were normal. She had good strength in the lower extremities. Planters were down going. She had severe tenderness in the mid-thoracic spine with minor gibbous formation. Her pain score was 9/10.
Imaging studies
The studies showed a severe compression fracture of the seventh thoracic vertebral body, with almost completely flattened in its anterior part (Figure ).
Description of the device
Stabilink Interlaminar fixation system (SIFS) (Southern Spine LCC, Macon, GA) was used (Figure ) for the PIMF. The system has a “Laminar Lock” design and forms a 90° flare to have a stronger hold on the laminar bone. There are 16 spikes per implant over a wide area for increased load sharing. Furthermore, it has torque controlled locking mechanism.
Surgical procedure
The procedure was done in an outpatient surgery center; and patient was discharged home on the same day after surgery. The procedure was done in prone position using local anesthetics and heavy sedation. In addition, the procedure was done using fluoroscopic imaging. A midline 3-centimeter incision was made. The paraspinal muscles were separated from the posterior neural arch of thoracic sixth and seventh vertebrae. The interspinous ligament was excised deep down to the ligamentum flavum. Bony margins of the spinous processes in the interspace were roughened. The interspinal space just above the level of the laminae was measured. An appropriate size device was then inserted between the spinous processes deep down until the spikes of the device reached the laminae. The wings of the device were then compressed into the bone. The system was then locked in position (Figure ). Demineralized bone matrix (NuFuze, Nu Tech Spine and Biologics, Birmingham, AL) was then placed between the roughened surfaces of the spinous processes. The wound was then closed.
Results
There was no complication from the operation. The blood loss was minimal. The patient reported immediate relief of severe pain after her operation. At two weeks after the operation, her pain score dropped to 0/10, was pain free even in upright position, and she stopped wearing the brace.

Laboratory data from a visit to another facility 2 months prior to this presentation were reportedly normal; her known baseline creatinine was 1 mg/dL. The patient reported unintentional weight loss of 7 pounds in less than 3 months. Review of systems was positive for chronic low back pain only.
She had taken 800 mg of ibuprofen daily for just over a month but stopped it several months prior to this presentation. She had no history of use of herbal medications or intravenous contrast. Her other comorbidities included asthma, restless leg syndrome, hypertension, chronic low back pain, depression, and anxiety. Her medications included aspirin 81 mg daily, pramipexole 0.5 mg at bedtime, albuterol inhaler as needed, buspirone 50 mg/day, risperidone 1 mg at bedtime, and topiramate (TPM) 100 mg twice a day for depression. The patient had remote smoking history of 1 pack per day from the age of 14 to 18 and no alcohol use. Her family history was non-contributory.
Physical examination showed an obese patient with blood pressure of 121/59, pulse 100 beats/minute, temperature 98.2°F (36.8°C), respiratory rate 16, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. She was alert, oriented, and in no distress. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed clear breath sounds bilaterally without wheezes or rhonchi, and normal heart sounds with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Abdominal examination showed no tenderness, masses, or organomegaly. She had neither focal neurologic deficit nor edema of the lower extremities.
Her laboratory data () showed normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis, with glucosuria in the setting of normal serum glucose and hemoglobin A1C of 5.8. She also had hypouricemia and hypokalemia. However, serum phosphorus level was normal. In this setting of metabolic acidosis, urine pH was noted to be 6.5. Urine analysis at initial evaluation showed also proteinuria without evidence of infection (); it had been normal 9 months before.
Urine electrolytes are shown in ; her fractional excretion of sodium was 3. Urine anion gap was 30.7 (urine sodium added to urine potassium minus urine chloride).
The foregoing suggested proximal tubular dysfunction. Given her elevated creatinine, proteinuria, and anemia, paraproteinemia was strongly considered. However, serum and urine protein electrophoresis as well as free kappa/lambda ratio were negative. Bone marrow biopsy was also negative for multiple myeloma. Thus, a diagnosis of generalized proximal renal tubular dysfunction (Fanconi syndrome) with acute kidney injury secondary to TPM was entertained. By then, the patient had been on the same dose of TPM for 38 months and on lower doses for 20 months prior. Creatinine levels checked 2 to 4 times a year ranged from 0.9 to 1.2 mg/dL. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale () indicated a probable relationship (score of 6) between TPM use and development of acute kidney injury and Fanconi syndrome. TPM was therefore tapered and discontinued by 1 week after the initial evaluation; by this time, her creatinine, bicarbonate, and potassium levels had worsened. Her laboratory function continued to improve consistently after stoppage of TPM until she had normal serum bicarbonate, potassium, and uric acid levels.

The patient had developed walking difficulties, balance impairment and ptosis of his right eye over the past few days, and developed progressive dyspnea in the last few hours before presentation to clinic. The ptosis of the right eye, as well as generalized muscle weakness, were apparent on primary examination in the ED.
The patient was known to have ongoing non-insulin dependent diabetes and metastasized prostate carcinoma.
At the ED, the patient’s temperature was 36.5 °C, heart rate was 95 beats per min, respiratory rate 26 was breaths per min, blood pressure was 190/110 mmHg, and oxygen saturation with 3 L O2 was 96%. The initial neurological examination showed a blepharoptosis, general muscular weakness, and disbalance. As such, our differential diagnosis included peripheral neuromuscular disease related to diabetes mellitus, with considerations for further diagnosis to rule out metastatic disease or paraneoplastic neurological disease. In relation to the patient’s complaint of progressive dyspnea, his electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of acute coronary syndrome.
Serial ECGs revealed signs of acute anterior wall myocardial infarct, although the patient had no typical symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome (Figure ). This finding was accompanied by raised serum high-sensitivity troponin levels (maximum 0.814 µg/L; normal range: 0-0.014 µg/L).
A conventional X-ray and computed tomography angiography of the chest showed no pulmonary embolism or parenchymal abnormalities, except for atelectasis of both lower lung fields. An emergency coronary angiography showed no obstructive coronary lesions (Figure ).
The patient’s respiratory condition quickly deteriorated and he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypercapnic failure, where he was successfully stabilized with non-invasive ventilation (bilevel pressure support).

He has no known family history of cancer on either side and did not undergo genetic testing at the time of his initial cancer management.
He initially presented to oculoplastics for a mass of the right lower eyelid that had been enlarging over 3 months (); biopsy showed sebaceous cell carcinoma with genetic testing showing loss of MLH1 and PMH2 expression (). These findings, in conjunction with his prior colorectal cancer, resulted in his diagnosis with MTS.
A few months prior to his presentation, he had undergone routine radiographic surveillance with Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT and colonoscopy at an outside hospital, and was found to have both a left renal kidney mass and a 5 cm irregular, ulcerated, and friable mass near the site of his prior surgical anastomosis, which was obstructing the majority of the lumen. Biopsy of the colonic lesion was consistent with mucin-producing adenocarcinoma with signet ring features.
The patient was scheduled to undergo a complete colectomy with left nephrectomy but presented to the emergency department the night prior to his scheduled surgery for hematochezia. He was anemic with a Hb of 6.7 but otherwise hemodynamically stable. He was given one unit of packed red blood cells and taken to the operating room the following morning for exploration and resection of the tumors.
He was found to have a firm mass at the site of the ileocolic anastomosis with two adherent loops of small bowel. The mass was not tethered to any other structures. He underwent a total abdominal colectomy with primary anastomosis as well as resection of the involved loops of bowel with primary anastomosis. Urology performed a left radical nephrectomy which was complicated by significant bleeding from a renal vein injury which was ultimately controlled with the assistance of vascular surgery.

At birth the weight was 934 g (−3 SD), length 34.5 cm (−2 SD), and head circumference 25.5 cm (−1.5 SD). Apgar scores were 5 at 1 min and 6 at 5 min. In spite of antenatal corticosteroid administration, the infant was intubated after birth and placed on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. The placenta (weight 240 g) was delivered intact, and macro- and microscopic examinations revealed no pathology such as malformations, infarction, or chorioamnionitis. Chest radiographs confirmed the initial diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome, and surfactant treatment was administered. Clinical manifestations disclosed dysmorphic features including high forehead, large rectangular nose continuing to the eyebrows, hypertelorism, low-set ears and carp-shaped mouth (). Postnatal US revealed an atrial septal defect and bilateral renal hypoplasia. He responded promptly to the surfactant treatment, the ventilatory course was favourable, and he was weaned from the ventilator by 9 days of age.

He was born in full-term, with a weight of 1.8 kilograms (kg) and a height of 40 centimeters (cm). Apart from growth failure, no developmental delay was presented. He reached his final height of 143 cm at his 14s and his maximum weight was 42 kg at his 15s. The patient repeatedly experienced infection of the upper respiratory tract during his childhood, and he was diagnosed with “acute type A hepatitis” at his 1.5 years. He was also diagnosed with “cytomegalovirus pneumonia” at 8 years old. The patient showed facial erythema since he was 2 years old. One year ago, the patient developed well-demarcated patchy areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation. In 2013, when he was 13 years old, the patient started to experience polydipsia, polyphagia, and polyuria. His fasting blood glucose (FBG) was revealed to be 19 mmol/L, and the urinary ketone body was positive. C-peptide level and type 1 diabetes-related auto-antibodies were unknown. Though with 14 units insulin aspart for each meal and 21 units glargine insulin a day, his blood glucose was not controlled well (FBG 8-14 mmol/L, and 2 hours postprandial glucose 10-18 mmol/L). Four years after diabetes onset, his fasting C-peptide (FCP) was 1.70 ng/mL and 2 hours postprandial C peptide (2hCP) was 3.19 ng/mL, with simultaneous FBG 13 mmol/L and 2 hours postprandial glucose (2hPG) 27 mmol/L. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 10%. In January 2019, a total of 36 U insulin aspart and insulin glargine 38 U per day still failed to control his glucose. In June 2019, the patient went to our department.
The proband’s parents denied consanguinity. His grandmother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in her 60s. His father was also diagnosed with T2D when he was 43 years old, with a body mass index (BMI) of 33.1 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a height of 143 cm and a weight of 37 kg (BMI 18.09 kg/m2), his waist circumference was only 60 cm. Symmetrical erythema can be seen on his face (), areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation scattered. Tanner stage was V, with a length of penis 6 cm and the volume of bilateral testes was 8 ml, respectively. No other abnormalities discovered. BS was suspected and further clinical investigation was implemented.
His glycated albumin (GA%) was 22.4% and HbA1c was 10.2%, which suggested poor glycemic control with a high dose of insulin (2 U/kg·d, 74 units per day). FCP was 0.43 ng/mL, and 2hCP was 1.91 ng/mL, while synchronous FBG was 9.3 mmol/L and 2hPG was 15.7 mmol/L, indicating islet dysfunction.

He was born in full-term, with a weight of 1.8 kilograms (kg) and a height of 40 centimeters (cm). Apart from growth failure, no developmental delay was presented. He reached his final height of 143 cm at his 14s and his maximum weight was 42 kg at his 15s. The patient repeatedly experienced infection of the upper respiratory tract during his childhood, and he was diagnosed with “acute type A hepatitis” at his 1.5 years. He was also diagnosed with “cytomegalovirus pneumonia” at 8 years old. The patient showed facial erythema since he was 2 years old. One year ago, the patient developed well-demarcated patchy areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation. In 2013, when he was 13 years old, the patient started to experience polydipsia, polyphagia, and polyuria. His fasting blood glucose (FBG) was revealed to be 19 mmol/L, and the urinary ketone body was positive. C-peptide level and type 1 diabetes-related auto-antibodies were unknown. Though with 14 units insulin aspart for each meal and 21 units glargine insulin a day, his blood glucose was not controlled well (FBG 8-14 mmol/L, and 2 hours postprandial glucose 10-18 mmol/L). Four years after diabetes onset, his fasting C-peptide (FCP) was 1.70 ng/mL and 2 hours postprandial C peptide (2hCP) was 3.19 ng/mL, with simultaneous FBG 13 mmol/L and 2 hours postprandial glucose (2hPG) 27 mmol/L. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 10%. In January 2019, a total of 36 U insulin aspart and insulin glargine 38 U per day still failed to control his glucose. In June 2019, the patient went to our department.
The proband’s parents denied consanguinity. His grandmother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in her 60s. His father was also diagnosed with T2D when he was 43 years old, with a body mass index (BMI) of 33.1 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a height of 143 cm and a weight of 37 kg (BMI 18.09 kg/m2), his waist circumference was only 60 cm. Symmetrical erythema can be seen on his face (), areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation scattered. Tanner stage was V, with a length of penis 6 cm and the volume of bilateral testes was 8 ml, respectively. No other abnormalities discovered. BS was suspected and further clinical investigation was implemented.

Further investigation led to a diagnosis of extramammary Paget's disease, for which surgical excision under general anesthesia was planned. The patient had a medical history of hypertension and asymptomatic cerebral infarction and was on aspirin. He had no significant family history. Electrocardiography revealed complete right bundle branch block, and blood tests did not show any notable abnormalities.
Anesthesia induction was performed with propofol 60 mg, fentanyl 100 μg, remifentanil 0.1 μg/kg/min, and rocuronium 50 mg. Maintenance of anesthesia was achieved using sevoflurane 1%, remifentanil at a rate of 0.1–0.15 μg/kg/min, and intermittent administration of rocuronium 10 mg. An 8-mm endotracheal tube was used for intubation. Intraoperatively, the patient's hemodynamics and oxygenation were stable without any significant abnormalities. Brain function monitoring to assess sedation levels was not performed intraoperatively and was not used to assess sedation levels. The surgery lasted for 2 h and 49 min. The surgical procedure was completed uneventfully, following which the administration of anesthesia was discontinued. When the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane reached 0.1%–0.2%, the patient was awakened, and eye opening was observed. After confirming the patient's consciousness, sugammadex was administered, and extubation was performed. A few minutes after extubation, the patient's level of consciousness was observed to decrease, subsequently reaching a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of E1V1M1. His respiratory status remained stable. Considering the possibility of the effect of residual opioids, naloxone was administered, but with no change in the level of consciousness. His body temperature was 37.0°C. Prompt blood gas analysis was performed, which revealed normal pH and electrolyte levels. There were no signs of hypoglycemia (blood sugar 110 mg/dL) and no specific findings to explain the decrease in consciousness level. However, due to the emergence of right conjugate eye deviation, further investigations were conducted to evaluate for an intracranial pathology. Both head computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed, but no abnormal findings, such as new brain infarctions or intracranial hemorrhage, were detected (Figures and ). Since there were no respiratory or circulatory abnormalities, re-intubation was not performed. Preoperative systolic blood pressure was around 120 mmHg, and intraoperative systolic blood pressure remained at 100–130 mmHg. The patient was urgently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close observation. Approximately 1 h after admission to the ICU, the patient developed involuntary movements in the left upper limb, suggestive of a seizure. Based on the assumption of an epileptic seizure, 5 mg of diazepam was administered, which resulted in an improvement in the level of consciousness (GCS E4V5M6). No further obvious neurological abnormalities were observed. In addition, there were no changes in liver and kidney function before and after surgery (Figure ). Subsequently, levetiracetam administration was initiated from the first day after surgery. Electroencephalography (EEG) performed on the second day after surgery showed minimally significant findings. No seizures occurred thereafter, and the patient was discharged on the 16th day after surgery without any neurological complications.

Seven years before admission, she was diagnosed with SLE manifested by fatigue, anorexia, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, positive antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies, positive anti-RNP antibodies, and hypocomplementemia (C3 and C4). Initially, she was treated with corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, and mycophenolate mofetil having a good clinical response. However, she had poor adherence to these medications and self-discontinued her treatment after one year of therapy.
Two weeks prior to hospitalization at our institution, she was admitted to a community hospital due to high-grade fever (40.1°C), nausea, pancytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and ferritin levels. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) were positive at a titer of 1 : 1280 with a homogeneous pattern. Serum complements levels were normal. Blood cultures were negative, as well as tests for hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus, varicella-zoster virus IgM, herpes simplex virus IgM, cytomegalovirus IgM, and Epstein–Barr virus IgM. She was treated with methylprednisolone 60 mg IV daily and broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and cefepime. Also, fluconazole and acyclovir were added. The hospitalization was complicated with ventricular fibrillation which responded to nonsynchronized cardioversion. She had partial clinical improvement to this therapy and was discharged home, but three days later, she developed worsening of fever and malaise associated with abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.
Upon admission to our institution, she appeared acutely ill. Vital signs showed temperature of 39.5°C, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/65 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 per minute. Physical examination disclosed right upper quadrant abdominal pain without rebound tenderness or organomegaly. Bowel sounds were normal. She had symmetric polyarthritis involving the hands, wrists, and knees. She had petechial lesions on lower extremities and muscle wasting of upper and lower extremities. She had diffuse hair loss. No nasal or oral ulcers were observed. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable.

A peripheral smear revealed poikilocytosis, macrocytosis, anisocytosis, and ovalocytes. No schistocytes were seen. The reticulocyte count was normal at 1.6%. Alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, triglycerides, and ferritin levels were elevated as well as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Amylase and lipase levels were negative. Her renal function and urinalysis were within normal limits. Serum C3 complement levels were low at 70 mg/dL. Antinuclear, anti-ribonucleoprotein (97.4 U/mL) and anti-Ro antibodies (>100 U/mL) were elevated. Anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, anti-La, and anti-citrullinated peptide antibody levels were negative. Rheumatoid factor was negative.

The tuberculin test and blood, urine, and sputum cultures were negative. Chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram showed no abnormalities. Abdominal pelvic computer tomography disclosed an enlarged liver measuring 20.4 cm with fatty infiltration. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal treatment were started without improvement. Bone marrow biopsy revealed macrophages with engulfed erythrocytes consistent with MAS.
The patient was treated with cyclosporine 3 mg/kg/day and methylprednisolone 500 mg IV every day for 3 days, followed by 2 mg/kg/day IV every day. Also, she received IV immunoglobulins 20 g daily for 5 days. One day after initiating treatment, fever subsided. Five days after initiation of treatment, WBC count and hemoglobin levels continued to increase and liver enzymes returned to normal limits.
Upon discharge, WBC count, hemoglobin levels, platelet count, and ferritin levels continued to normalize. She was discharged on prednisone of 60 mg daily and cyclosporine 125 mg orally daily. She was continued on cyclosporine (3 mg/kg/day), and prednisone was gradually tapered down to 7.5 mg daily. After 12 months of follow-up, the patient remained in complete clinical remission of her MAS with normal WBC, hemoglobin, platelet count, liver enzymes, and ferritin levels.

Abdominal pelvic computer tomography disclosed an enlarged liver measuring 20.4 cm with fatty infiltration. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal treatment were started without improvement. Bone marrow biopsy revealed macrophages with engulfed erythrocytes consistent with MAS.
The patient was treated with cyclosporine 3 mg/kg/day and methylprednisolone 500 mg IV every day for 3 days, followed by 2 mg/kg/day IV every day. Also, she received IV immunoglobulins 20 g daily for 5 days. One day after initiating treatment, fever subsided. Five days after initiation of treatment, WBC count and hemoglobin levels continued to increase and liver enzymes returned to normal limits.
Upon discharge, WBC count, hemoglobin levels, platelet count, and ferritin levels continued to normalize. She was discharged on prednisone of 60 mg daily and cyclosporine 125 mg orally daily. She was continued on cyclosporine (3 mg/kg/day), and prednisone was gradually tapered down to 7.5 mg daily. After 12 months of follow-up, the patient remained in complete clinical remission of her MAS with normal WBC, hemoglobin, platelet count, liver enzymes, and ferritin levels.

mercury-containing facial cream: A case report","In Summer 2018, a 4-year-old boy was admitted with loss of weight (2 kg in 4 weeks),
weakness, fatigue, strong sweating, arterial hypertonia (114/104 mmHg) and
tachycardia (>150 bpm). Furthermore, he complained about non-specific abdominal
pain in stomach. He complained about non-specific joint pain in his ankles, without
any swelling, warming or redness, but severe enough that he demanded to be carried,
instead of walking himself. The boy’s behavior was shy and uncooperative. According
to his parents, he had been a lively and happy child before. Such a mixed
symptomatology is uncommon in children, and arterial hypertonia and weight loss in
particular merited detailed further analysis.
Blood tests were mainly unremarkable, except for elevated aldosterone levels. He was
discharged and 3.75 mg Amlodipine per day was prescribed to control his blood
pressure. However, the blood pressure continued to be increased, and the other
symptoms remained as well, resulting in further diagnostic tests. A chest X-ray and
whole-body magnetic resonance imaging showed no signs of tumors, but nonspecifically
enlarged lymph nodes were noted in the axilla and under the carotid sheath.
Microbiological studies and standard laboratory tests were negative. Due to the
ongoing hypertonia and tachycardia, 3.75 mg Propranolol three times per day was
added to his medication.
Six weeks after his first admission, the patient’s blood was tested for mercury, as
one of the authors remembered a similar case years ago. The leading symptom for the
differential diagnosis of a mercury intoxication was the arterial hypertension.
 The mercury levels () were extremely elevated compared to reference values and
significantly above the HBM-II (danger level) value proposed by the Human
Biomonitoring Commission of the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA). The mercury levels 6 weeks
after the first admission were in urine 19 µg/L (reference level 0.4 µg/L; HBM-II
level 25 µg/L), in urine corrected for creatinine 90 µg/g creatinine (no reference
level; HBM-II level 20 µg/L) and in blood 37 µg/L (reference level 0.8 µg/L; HBM-II
level 15 µg/L).
Soon after diagnosis, efforts were made to identify the source of exposure. Asked
about any unusual household remedies connected to the family’s origin (Balkan), the
mother explained that she had started using a face cream from Kosovo, which she had
bought online. Laboratory analyses of the cream revealed a mercury content of ~18%.
Mercury levels in comparable ranges have been previously reported for
skin-lightening creams.
However, the cream was not advertised as a skin-lightening cream, but for achieving
a better skin appearance. According to the manufacturer, the cream has an “immediate
effect and success in problems such as: Acne, pimples, facial scars after birth,
sunspots, signs after acne, etc.”
 Obviously, mercury was not listed as an “active” ingredient. Although we do
not know the exact composition of the cream, Hg was likely added in the form of
inorganic salts such as Hg2Cl2 or
HgNH2Cl. The mother insisted that she had never used the cream on her
children. Nevertheless, blood and urine samples from all family members were also
analyzed (). As
expected, the mother`s mercury levels were extremely high due to the use of the
cream over several months. The patient’s 9-year-old brother also showed elevated
mercury levels. Surprisingly, both mother and brother showed no clinical signs of
mercury poisoning. The father’s mercury levels were only partially available and
relatively low.
To exclude any other sources of exposure, the family’s apartment was thoroughly
inspected. Ambient air monitoring revealed no elevated mercury levels compared to
local background levels (~0.1 µg/m3). Analyses of dust samples from the
family’s vacuum cleaner showed values of up to 68 µg/g dust, which is significantly
higher than the reference value (0.15 µg/g) for indoor dust samples.
 Repeated analyses of indoor dust samples showed a decrease in mercury levels
over time (). Dust
samples from the parent’s bedroom, taken approximately 4 months after the
identification of the source, showed higher levels compared to the other rooms (8.4
µg/g vs 3.3 µg/kg in the living room and 5.4 µg/g in the children’s bedroom).
In addition, hair samples (~30 cm long) from the mother were taken about 4 months
after she had stopped using the cream. The hair was cut into 2-cm-long segments and
analyzed. The results are shown in . The lowest mercury levels were found closest to the scalp.
Mercury levels increased with growth distance from the skin reaching up to 89 µg/g
hair (alert level 1 µg/g hair).
 Until 14 cm length, mercury levels increased exponentially. Thereafter, the
increase was linear. The levels found in the mother’s hair were higher than what has
been previously reported for the use of skin-lightening creams.
The patient immediately received oral chelation therapy with 40 mg
Dimaval® (2,3-Dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid) twice per day. His
condition improved rapidly and he could be discharged. Oral chelation therapy was
continued until mercury levels were below the HBM-I value ().
Six months after hospital discharge, the patient’s urinary and blood mercury levels
decreased significantly () and his symptoms had disappeared. Follow-up visits were by now
performed for 18 months since treatment. No potential re-exposure was identified, no
long-term effects were observed.","[[4.0, 'year']]",M,2021-06-28,heart,"Mercury poisoning of a 4-year-old child by indirect contact to a

He was prescribed diuretics at the local clinic for his symptoms; however, his symptoms did not improve. In laboratory tests, his hemoglobin (Hb) was 11.8 g/dL (normal range: 14–17 g/dL), total bilirubin was 6.65 mg/dL (normal range: 0.3–1.2 mg/dL), prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) was 1.36 (normal range: 0.8–1.2), and serum albumin was 2.6 g/dL (normal range: 4.0–5.3 g/dL). The Child Pugh score was C11, and the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was 17. Initial abdominal CT showed cirrhotic features of the liver, and there were multiple collateral vessel including esophageal, paraesophageal, and paraumbilical varices and gastrorenal shunt, and a large amount of ascites in the abdominal cavity. He was treated with furosemide (40 mg) and spironolactone (100 mg) once a day, and repeated paracentesis for a large volume of ascites. For the first two weeks after hospitalization, 2.5 L of ascites was drained per week, and from the 15th day after hospitalization, 1 L of ascites was drained every day. However, even on the 20th day of hospitalization, the amount of ascites did not decrease significantly, and the patient’s symptoms of dyspnea and abdominal distension persisted. TIPS was planned as a further treatment method for intractable ascites.
After the selection of the right hepatic vein, the right posterior portal vein was punctured using a Colapinto needle (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) on the third attempt with targeting guidewire at the right hepatic artery under US guidance. A portosystemic shunt was ballooned with 4 mm × 4 cm and 6 mm × 10 cm mustang balloon catheters (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA). Subsequently, a 10 mm × 10 cm Covera Plus self-expandable stent graft (BARD, Tempe, AZ, USA) was placed between the right hepatic vein and the right posterior portal vein. After stent insertion, the portocaval pressure gradient decreased from 41 to 20 mm Hg. Final venography revealed patent shunt flow and no findings suggesting complications ().
After the procedure, there were no immediate complications, but PT-INR and MELD scores were aggravated to 2.01 and 22, respectively. On the 6th day after the procedure, the patient complained of melena. The source of bleeding was unclear during gastroscopy and colonoscopy. Doppler ultrasonography was performed to evaluate TIPS patency. The shunt was patent, and there were no other specific findings. One unit of red blood cells (RBCs) was transfused every day; however, the Hb level continuously decreased (from 8.3 g/dL to 7.3 g/dL, normal range: 12–17 g/dL) until the 8th day after the procedure.
On the 9th day after the procedure, massive hematochezia occurred, and hypotension (systolic and diastolic blood pressure: 82/48 mm Hg) was observed. In laboratory tests, the Hb level was 3.0 g/dL and PT-INR was 5.15. CT angiography was performed to evaluate the bleeding focus. Massive contrast extravasation to the common bile duct and second part of the duodenum was noted, and life threatening fistula formation between the right intrahepatic duct and the right hepatic artery was highly suspected on CT angiography (). Emergency embolization for a suspected arterio-biliary fistula was requested.
Hepatic arteriography in the early arterial phase showed contrast extravasation to the common bile duct, confirming an arterio-biliary fistula, but a direct fistula between the right hepatic artery and the right intrahepatic bile duct was not definite. Selective arteriography revealed active bleeding at multiple small branches of the eighth segmental hepatic artery and multiple small branches of the fifth segmental hepatic artery, leading to an arterio-biliary fistula. Coil embolization of the eighth segmental hepatic artery using 4 mm × 15 cm and 5 mm × 15 cm interlocking detachable coils (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA), embolization of the fifth segmental hepatic artery using glue (N-butyl cyanoacrylate; Histoacryl, B.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain showed a solitary 4.6 cm × 3.4 cm × 4.1 cm heterogeneous solid mass at the right temporo-parietal junction with surrounding edema, mass effect, and early uncal herniation suggestive of either a metastasis or high-grade primary lesion [Figure and ]. Computed tomography (CT) of her abdomen and pelvis did not show any primary or metastatic lesion. The patient received dexamethasone, which improved her symptoms, and then underwent surgical resection of the tumor in March 2016. Histopathological examination of the resected tumor revealed an epithelial neoplasm with squamous differentiation and extensive keratinization. The tumor cells displayed considerable anaplasia, and mitoses were numerous [Figure and ]. There was a sharp demarcation between the tumor tissue and the surrounding compressed cerebral parenchyma, which showed gliosis and nerve fiber degeneration []. Immunohistochemical stains revealed strong positivity for cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK5/6 [Figure and ], and also immunopositive for human papilloma virus (HPV), which was confirmed by in situ hybridization for HPV [].
Postoperative MRI [Figure and ] of her brain showed gross total resection of the lesion. The patient experienced no neurological complications postoperatively and was recovering well at the time of discharge. In April 2016, a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan of the patient's head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. The patient had a repeat MRI [Figure and ] of her head in April 2016, which showed no evidence of tumor progression and significantly improved edema around the resection area. Clinically, she was back to independent living without any neurological deficits. She was subsequently treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity with a dose of 18 Gy to the 50% isodose curve.
In July 2016, the patient had a left-sided focal clonic seizure and an episode of left-sided weakness. An MRI showed a new single metastatic tumor measuring 2.3 × 3.5 cm2 noted in the right temporo-parietal area with significant surrounding edema within temporal lobe and extending into right parietal and occipital lobes [Figure –]. Given her excellent performance status and only solitary recurrence, she underwent resection of this second metastatic lesion in July 2016 with a postoperative MRI that showed successful tumor resection with residual edema causing minimal left midline shift [Figure and ], and another treatment of SRS to the resection cavity in August 2016. Another PET/CT scan of her head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was obtained; it showed small bilateral lung nodules in the right middle lobe and ligula likely of inflammatory origin but still concerning of metastases. Given the size and the imaging characteristics of the lesions, decision was made not to biopsy the lesion and obtaining repeat imaging in 6 months that reported stable nodules with no signs of progression; therefore these lesions were unlikely to be metastases. Serial repeat MRIs showed no evidence of disease progression and clinically she remained independent without any neurological symptoms. The plan for the patient is continued monitoring symptoms along with repeat MRI every 3 months.","[[75.0, 'year']]",F,2017,cervical,"Cervical cancer metastasis to the brain: A case report and review of literature A 75-year-old female with a history of stage IIIB squamous cell cancer of the cervix, which had been treated and in remission for about 2 years, presented in February 2016 with several weeks of decreased coordination and decreased balance with weakness and clumsiness noted especially on her left side in addition to a left facial droop. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain showed a solitary 4.6 cm × 3.4 cm × 4.1 cm heterogeneous solid mass at the right temporo-parietal junction with surrounding edema, mass effect, and early uncal herniation suggestive of either a metastasis or high-grade primary lesion [Figure and ]. Computed tomography (CT) of her abdomen and pelvis did not show any primary or metastatic lesion. The patient received dexamethasone, which improved her symptoms, and then underwent surgical resection of the tumor in March 2016. Histopathological examination of the resected tumor revealed an epithelial neoplasm with squamous differentiation and extensive keratinization. The tumor cells displayed considerable anaplasia, and mitoses were numerous [Figure and ]. There was a sharp demarcation between the tumor tissue and the surrounding compressed cerebral parenchyma, which showed gliosis and nerve fiber degeneration []. Immunohistochemical stains revealed strong positivity for cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK5/6 [Figure and ], and also immunopositive for human papilloma virus (HPV), which was confirmed by in situ hybridization for HPV [].
Postoperative MRI [Figure and ] of her brain showed gross total resection of the lesion. The patient experienced no neurological complications postoperatively and was recovering well at the time of discharge. In April 2016, a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan of the patient's head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. The patient had a repeat MRI [Figure and ] of her head in April 2016, which showed no evidence of tumor progression and significantly improved edema around the resection area. Clinically, she was back to independent living without any neurological deficits. She was subsequently treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity with a dose of 18 Gy to the 50% isodose curve.

The PV of the donor liver was anastomosed to the recipient PV trunk in an end-to-end fashion using the branch-patch technique due to the small diameter of the recipient PV trunk. As a sufficient PV flow was not obtained, the anastomosis was immediately revised with an interposition of the donor’s grafted ovarian vein, but the PV flow still did not recover. An emergency intraoperative portal venogram via the middle colic vein showed an almost complete obstruction at the anastomotic site (Fig. a). As further surgical revisions were unlikely to restore the PV flow, we placed two SEMSs inside the reconstructed PV, overlapped each other to cover the area from the porto-splenic junction to the umbilical portion (UP) of the grafted PV (Fig. b).
